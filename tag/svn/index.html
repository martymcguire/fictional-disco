<p>I recently had the need to migrate a project from a <a title="http://subversion.tigris.org/" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> (SVN) repository that was shared among many other projects and groups to a fresh repository where it would be the first of many projects.</p>

<p>My first instinct was to simply use <code>svnadmin dump</code> to dump out the contents of the whole shared repository, transfer that to the new machine, use <code>svnadmin load</code> to load the data into the new repository, and then delete out the projects that I did not want.</p>

<p>The first pass at this created a 2.5GB dump file, something which I did not want to send over the network!  After poking around at the options for <code>svnadmin dump</code>, I found that I could shrink this down to about 1GB by using the <code>&ndash;deltas</code> flag, which saves space by dumping only the differences between each revision in the repository.  1GB was still pretty big, but we have a fast network, so it wasn&rsquo;t that painful.  I transferred it to the new server, created a new repository, and ran <code>svnadmin load</code> to load the dump into the repository.</p>

<p>All I had to do next was delete the directories from the repository that I didn&rsquo;t want.  I knew this would be a little tricky because I didn&rsquo;t want to keep <em>any</em> code from those projects around, and simply running <code>svn delete</code> on each directory would have kept the other projects in the repository&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p>As it turns out, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#removal">you can&rsquo;t just remove all traces of something from a Subversion repository</a>.  The reasons for this are many, but they simply haven&rsquo;t gotten around to implementing <code>svn oblitherate</code>, yet.  The current solution is to create a dump with <code>svnadmin dump</code>, and then process that file with a tool called <code>svndumpfilter</code>.</p>

<p>The docs for <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/ch05s03.html#svn-ch-5-sect-3.1.3"><code>svndumpfilter</code></a> are pretty straightforward, so I tried using it on the dump file I had already created, but no matter what I did I kept getting this error:</p>

<pre>svndumpfilter: Unsupported dumpfile version: 3</pre>

<p>What the docs (and error message) don&rsquo;t tell you is that <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=2760"><code>svndumpfilter</code> only works on full dump files</a>, and doesn&rsquo;t support dump files made with the <code>&ndash;deltas</code> flag.
<h3>Long Story Short (Too Late)</h3>
In the end, what I wanted was simple, but not obvious.  On the original server, I ran:</p>

<pre lang="bash">
svnadmin dump /path/to/original/repository | \
    svndumpfilter include my_project \
               --drop-empty-revs \
               --renumber-revs > dump_file</pre>

<p>I was then able to copy the resulting (much, much smaller!) dump file to the new machine, blow away and re-create the new repository, and load it with <code>svnadmin load</code>.</p>

<p>And now maybe you can learn from this example instead of having to figure it out yourself through trial-and-error!</p>
