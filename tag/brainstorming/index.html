<p><i>Update: thanks to Ryan Barrett for pointing me to his <a href="https://snarfed.org/2015-11-29_keep-bridgy-publish-dumb">Keep Bridgy Publish dumb</a> post, which explains why Bridgy doesn't include the features mentioned below!</i></p>

<p><i>Nerd alert: This post is me geeking out and will involve talk of protocols.</i></p>

<p>In keeping with the IndieWeb concept of <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> (Publishing on my Own Site, Syndicating Elsewhere), I try to make social media posts on my own site first and then make similar (not always identical!) posts to my accounts on silos like Twitter and Facebook. I then add links to the posts on my site indicating that you can find the "syndicated copies" of that post on those silos.</p>
<p>My process for doing this is something like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Make a new post, likely with a micropub client like <a href="https://quill.p3k.io/">Quill</a>.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Log in to Twitter and make a similar post, making note of the URL to the new tweet.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Log in to Facebook and make a similar post, making note of the URL to the new FB post.</li>
  <li>Edit the metadata to my post to indicate the new syndication links.</li>
  <li>Re-publish the post on my site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the way my site is set up, this manual process requires the use of my laptop, so I can't do it on the go.</p>
<p>When thinking of ways to automate this process, I found myself drawn to another nice IndieWeb tool called <a href="https://telegraph.p3k.io/">Telegraph</a>. Telegraph takes the URL for a post, finds links inside that post, and (if they support <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/">webmentions</a>) allows me to notify those sites about that my post links to theirs with a single click.</p>

</figure>
<p>I like the way Telegraph works for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    It's not purpose-built for a single website - it can be used for sending webmentions from any site that publishes their content with the right markup to any site that can receive them.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>It puts the final decision to send a mention in my hands - I can choose to send mentions to any particular link mentioned in my post, or not.</li>
  <li>With a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a>, the process of sending webmentions becomes very simple. I visit the page for my post, click my Telegraph bookmark in my browser, and Telegraph shows me the links and send buttons for my post.</li>
</ul>
<p>There already exists a great tool for copying content from my site to certain silos: <a href="https://brid.gy/">brid.gy</a>. While brid.gy's primary use case is to use webmentions to syndicate comments and other activity from silos onto your own site, brid.gy also has a <a href="https://brid.gy/about#publishing">Publish</a> feature which accepts a URL from your site and attempts to create a similar post on the silo of your choice. Brid.gy Publish is a great feature, and I make good use of it. However, there are still a few pain points that I feel when using it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    While Brid.gy Publish gives a nice preview of what it will do, I can't tweak the content before publishing without editing my own post.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Brid.gy does not, as far as I can tell, support bookmarklet functionality. So, publishing takes multiple steps: <ol>
  <li>Visit my brid.gy profile page for a particular silo account.</li>
  <li>Enter the URL for the post on my site.</li>
  <li>Approve the post.</li>
  <li>Copy the URL for the new silo post from brid.gy.<ul>
  <li><strong>Note:</strong> These steps <i>can</i> be <a href="https://brid.gy/about#webmentions">automated via hidden links and webmentions</a>, and it even <a href="https://brid.gy/about#response">returns the URL for the new post</a>. However, this comes at the cost of the ability to preview what is to be posted.</li></ul></li></ol></li>
  <li>Finally, while Brid.gy lets me know in its UI that my post succeeded, Brid.gy has no mechanism for informing my site that the new syndicated post is available. I still need to enter the syndication URLs into my post manually and re-publish my post.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that groundwork of existing tools, here is what (I think) my ideal workflow would look like:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Make a new post to my site, likely with a micropub client like Quill.
  </li>
  <li>While looking at my post, click a bookmarklet that takes me to a syndication tool.</li>
  <li>The syndication tool shows me previews of what my post would look like on each silo where I'd like to publish. I can tweak the content, if needed.</li>
  <li>A single "Publish" click for each silo would create the post on that silo, but would <i>also</i> update my website with the new syndication link.</li>
</ol>
<p>This tool seems non-trivial to implement, but I think there are several building blocks which could be quite useful:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/kylewm/silo.pub">silo.pub</a> is a micropub-to-multiple-silos service that can simplify the process of getting content into silos. Brid.gy Publish also does much of this.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/">Micropub</a> supports <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#source-content">querying source properties of a given post</a>. (it also supports <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#syndication-targets">querying for a list of syndication targets</a>, but this seems primarily intended for setups where the micropub server itself will handle the syndication).</li>
  <li>Micropub supports <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#update">updates</a>. this could be used to add the syndication targets back to the original post. In fact, this <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#add">use case is in the spec</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not currently aware of anyone who does POSSE with this particular flow. I would be interested to know other folks' thoughts on this! Feel free to let me know with a post on your own site that mentions this one, or hit me up in the <a href="https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/">#indieweb-dev IRC chat</a>!</p>
