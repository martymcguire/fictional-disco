    <div class="post e-content">
<p>This post gives more technical detail for the <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/03/12/110809/">recent talk that I gave at Bring-a-Hack NYC</a>. In it, I describe a system that copies posts from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ghostpartyimprov/">Ghost Party's Instagram</a> automatically to the <a href="https://ghostparty.today/">Ghost Party Website at ghostparty.today</a>.</p>
<p>This roughly works like so:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://ownyourgram.com/">OwnYourGram</a> periodically checks our Instagram for new images
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>For each new post, it makes a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub">Micropub</a> request to a service that I wrote for this purpose.</li>
  <li>The endpoint accepts the image files and uploads them to our site using the Neocities API. Then it creates some new HTML from the micropub post data, edits the site's main index.html page to include the content, then uploads it back to Neocities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Authorization with IndieAuth</h2>
<p>One missing step in that rough outline is the bit where we tell OwnYourGram *how* to post to our site via Micropub, as well as making sure that OwnYourGram can prove that we have given it permission to post there. Many Micropub clients support <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a> as a way to do this permission-granting step (known as authorization). With a typical personal website, I'd delegate this process to <a href="https://indieauth.com/">indieauth.com</a>, which lets you offload the step of "proving" that you own the website where you're trying to post by instead letting you log into an existing social network account.</p>
<p>ghostparty.today is a shared website, so I thought a simpler way to approach this would be to create a custom authorization endpoint that accepts a password. I could give this password to other GHOST PARTY folks and they can post whatever they like.</p>
<p>Some nice folks in the IndieWeb community had already created an authorization endpoint that works this way, called <a href="https://github.com/Inklings-io/selfauth">selfauth</a>. I created a pretty simplistic port of selfauth from PHP to JavaScript using NodeJS on the awesome <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch social code hosting platform</a>. It needs some more robust error checking, and some micropub clients seem to have trouble with it, but it works with OwnYourGram and <a href="https://quill.p3k.io/">Quill</a>, so it's Good Enough for now!</p>

<h2>Micropub Endpoint</h2>
<p>Finally, there's the Micropub endpoint itself. I based mine off of <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/crocus-garlic">this Glitch micropub project</a>, created by <a href="https://adambachman.org/">Adam Bachman</a> at <a href="https://indieweb.org/2018/Baltimore">IndieWebCamp Baltimore</a> this year. Specfically, I took the bits that verify the access token. From there, it was a matter of stumbling through various bits of handling a Micropub post, pulling in extra libraries as I needed them. I slowly added support for saving uploaded files to our Neocities site via the Neocities API, then for generating an HTML snippet for the new post, and finally for adding the post to the site's main page.</p>
<p>The process for adding the generated post content to the site itself is extremely retro. The Micropub endpoint actually downloads the HTML from https://ghostparty.today/index.html. Inside there is a comment that looks like:</p>
<pre>&lt;!-- NEW POSTS BELOW --&gt;</pre>
<p>So the new contents for index.html is everything before the comment, the comment, the new content, and then everything after the comment. Once that's constructed, the endpoint uploads index.html back to Neocities with the new contents.</p>
<p>
  You can find the source for the Micropub endpoint here: <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/prism-dirt">https://glitch.com/edit/#!/prism-dirt</a>
  <br />
</p>
<p>It should be possible to fork the project on Glitch and configure it to work with your own Neocities site! You'll need to use cURL with the Neocities API to generate an authorization token to configure the app, rather than saving username and password info in the project!</p>
<h2>Making ghostparty.today "IndieWeb-Readable"</h2>
<p>The GHOST PARTY site follows an extremely old-school publishing model where each post <i>only</i> exists as a small section of HTML on a single long page. This complicates things a bit because interacting with posts on the IndieWeb typically requires three things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A machine-readable "identity" <a href="https://indieweb.org/h-card">h-card</a> that says "who" this website is, including a logo, the site name, canonical URL.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>A machine-readable <a href="https://indieweb.org/h-feed">feed</a> that contains new posts, allowing people to follow our updates in their favorite <a href="https://indieweb.org/reader">indie reader</a>.</li>
  <li>A separate permalink URL for each post, containing <a href="https://indieweb.org/h-entry">machine-readable info about that post</a>, allowing other IndieWeb sites to "understand" the content when they want to RSVP to events, repost or like photos, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Microformats2 parsers like <a href="https://xray.p3k.io/">X-Ray</a> do a great job at parsing HTML page into meaningful data, but the programs that use the parsed data usually stop at the first thing they find. So, if I ask X-Ray to <a href="https://xray.p3k.io/parse?url=https%3A%2F%2Fghostparty.today%2F">parse https://ghostparty.today</a>/, this is what it sees:</p>
<pre>{
  "data":{
    "type":"card",
    "name":"GHOST PARTY",
    "url":"https://ghostparty.today/",
    "photo":"https://ghostparty.neocities.org/ghost-party-logo.png"
  },
  "url":"https://ghostparty.today/",
  "code":200
}</pre>
<p>This is great in that it contains the "identity" information that we want the page to have. However, that page also has a feed! How can I get at that? By telling X-Ray to only look at a <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Fragment.html">fragment of the page</a>! Here's how X-Ray <a href="https://xray.p3k.io/parse?url=https%3A%2F%2Fghostparty.today%2F%23feed">sees https://ghostparty.today/#feed</a>: </p>
<pre>{
  "data":{
    "type":"feed",
    "items":[
      {
        "type":"entry",
        "published":"2018-03-07T16:44:16+00:00",
        "url":"https://ghostparty.today/#2018-03-07-181020",
        "photo":["https://ghostparty.today/uploads/2018-03-07/181020-ig0LN1JG.jpg"],
        "content":{"text":"snow day selfie #snowday #snowfie #ghoststories"} 
      },
      {
        "type":"entry",
        ...
      },
      ...
    ],
    "url":"https://ghostparty.today/#feed",
    "code":200,
    "info":{"found_fragment":true}
  }
}</pre>
<p>
  Data! Nice! So if we want to follow ghostparty.today with an indie reader, we use <code>https://ghostparty.today/#feed</code> as the URL.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Looking at the content of the feed, you'll notice that the individual items have a url property which <i>also</i> has a fragment ID in the URL. This allows IndieWeb sites to interact with a particular post, even though it's one of many on the same page. For example, I was able to <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/01/31/224122/">create an RSVP post to the most recent Ghost Party show</a>, and (by looking just at the content in the fragment at <code>https://ghostparty.today/#show-2018-02-14</code>) my site was able to pick up the machine-readable details about the event to display them on my own site.</p>
<p>The microformats markup for the h-card and h-feed are built into the index.html file itself and don't change very often. However, for each new micropub post we need to convert those properties into a chunk of HTML for the index.html page that <i>also</i> contains the microformats h-entry markup. To do this, I made <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/prism-dirt?path=views/entry.handlebars:1:0">this Handlebars template</a>:</p>
<pre><code>{% raw %}&lt;div class="h-entry" id="{{ mp-slug }}"&gt;
  &lt;a class="u-author" href="/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a class="u-url" href="#{{ mp-slug }}"&gt;{{#if name}}&lt;h2 class="p-name"&gt;{{ name }}&lt;/h2&gt;{{/if}}&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;time class="dt-published" datetime="{{ published }}"&gt;&lt;/time&gt;
  {{#if video}}
    {{#each video}}
      &lt;video controls loop class="u-video" src="{{ . }}"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
    {{/each}}
  {{ else }}
    {{#each photo}}
      &lt;img class="u-photo" src="{{ . }}" /&gt;
    {{/each}}
    {{#each audio}}
      &lt;audio class="u-audio" src="{{ . }}"&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
    {{/each}}
  {{/if}}
  &lt;div class="e-content"&gt;{{ content }}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img src="ghosts.gif" /&gt;
{% endraw %}</code></pre>
<p>Not so bad!</p>

  <h1 class="post-title p-name"><a href="/2017/01/26/flask-indieauth---a-python-library-for-micropub-servers/">Flask-IndieAuth - A Python Library for Micropub Servers</a></h1>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  
  
    
    <div class="post e-content">
<p class="">One of the things I like about the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>&nbsp;community is that while they are <a href="https://indieweb.org/selfdogfood">building tools for themselves</a>, they also tend to <a href="https://github.com/tantek/cassis">release</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/XRay">useful</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/kylewm/flask-micropub">parts</a>&nbsp;under Free Software licenses. This helps other developers join the community more quickly, but it also tends to help improve the quality and feature sets of these projects as others use and add to the source.<br></p><p class="">One of my favorite things to come from the IndieWeb folks is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/">Micropub API standard</a>, which defines some simple protocols for clients to send post data (the kinds of things you'd share on a blog or social media: images, short plain text, long articles, tags, and more) to servers for posting. One upshot is that if your server accepts Micropub, you can use one of many clients to put content on your site. I'm using a dedicated editor from&nbsp;<a href="https://quill.p3k.io/">Aaron Parecki's Quill</a> to write this post, but there are <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients">lots of alternatives</a>&nbsp;that are aimed at special use cases. For example, <a href="https://woodwind.xyz">Kyle Mahan's Woodwind</a>&nbsp;is an IndieWeb reader app that happens to include functionality for posting replies, favorites, reposts, and even RSVPs directly to my site via Micropub.</p><p class="">Another favorite is the idea of&nbsp;<a href="http://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a>&nbsp;for web sign-in. At a high level, the idea is that you create two-way links between your website and your user profile on some other silo. For example, on your homepage you add a link to your Twitter profile and on your Twitter profile you link back to your homepage. For a client that supports IndieAuth, I can log in using my homepage URL by verifying that I can log in to my Twitter account.</p><p class="">My own personal Micropub implementation is a little pile of spaghetti Python code making use of the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>&nbsp;framework. I use IndieAuth to handle authentication (i.e. - proving that a post comes from an app that I've logged into) and authorization (i.e. - proving that I gave that app permission to post to my site). As I've started improving my Micropub implementation, I found it useful to extract that portion of my code into a library that can be used with other Flask applications.</p><h2>Introducing Flask-IndieAuth</h2><p class=""><a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/Flask-IndieAuth">Flask-IndieAuth</a>&nbsp;is a Flask extension that adds the ability to require a client to send a valid IndieAuth token when making requests to any route. For example:</p><pre>from flask_indieauth import requires_indieauth

@app.route('/micropub', methods=['GET','POST'])
@requires_indieauth
def handle_micropub():
    # ... handle the request</pre><p class="">The @requires_indieauth decorator runs before the code for the route. It currently looks for an IndieAuth token in one of three places, in order:</p><ul><li>HTTP Header (e.g. "Authorization: Bearer xxxx...xx")<br></li><li>HTTP form data or query string (e.g. "?access_token=xxxx...xx")</li><li>The body of a JSON-encoded POST (e.g. {"access_token": "xxxx...xx"})</li></ul><p class="">If a token is found, it will be verified against the configured <a href="https://indieweb.org/token-endpoint">Token Endpoint</a>&nbsp;to confirm that it is a valid token issued for your server's configured homepage with a sufficient scope.</p><p class="">For more information on how to install, configure, and use Flask-IndieAuth, please check out the <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/Flask-IndieAuth#README">README on GitHub</a>.</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p class="">I'll be using this extension to build my <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#media-endpoint">Micropub media endpoint</a>&nbsp;(coming up in a future post) and so far it is working just fine. That said, I know there is a lot of room for improvement. Some things on my list:</p><ul><li>"scope" can have many values, but only "post" is supported for now. It should probably be passed as an argument to @requires_indieauth so different routes can have different requirements.<br></li><li>The configured homepage ("ME") is currently expected in the Flask app's config. I'm not sure if that's "standard".</li><li>"TOKEN_ENDPOINT" is currently expected in the Flask app's configuration, but since it is required to be specified in the HTTP headers for or as a &lt;link&gt; in the content for the homepage, this could be fetched by the server.</li><li>Error handling isn't great - all failure conditions currently return HTTP 400 (Bad Request) but should probably be diversified a bit.</li></ul><h2>Feedback Welcome!</h2><p class="">This is my first published Flask extension (heck, it's my first public Python package on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a>), and I'd really appreciate comments, questions, pull requests, etc. Feel free to reach out <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/Flask-IndieAuth/issues">on GitHub</a>, or you can find me in the <a href="https://chat.indieweb.org/">#indieweb chat</a> on freenode IRC.</p>
