    <div class="post e-content">
<p>I had a bit of time this weekend to tinker with my site.</p>
<p>The biggest change is one that happens totally behind the scenes - I've added a step to the service that compiles and deploys my site to automatically send <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">Webmentions</a> from my posts to posts that I am responding to or mentioning. There are many folks with projects around this, but they tend to be a little more aggressive than I like in finding URLs to send mentions to. For example, they often want to send mentions to my homepage and avatar image for my own posts!</p>
<p>So, I have added a Webmention sender to my site that is triggered by new and updated pages and sends mentions to any URLs that I am specifically <a href="https://indieweb.org/response">responding to</a> or <a href="https://indieweb.org/person-tag">person tagging</a>, along with any URLs mentioned in the actual content of the post.</p>
<p>Along with this, I now support person tags on regular entries <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/04/13/080659/">like this one</a>. I can add a tag like http://tantek.com to a post and it will tag them with proper markup and, if possible, show the name and photo from their homepage h-card.</p>
<p>Finally, I did a little cleanup in how I display reply contexts for other people's posts that have multiple images in them, like <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/04/08/082932/">this one from Aaron Parecki</a>.</p>
<p>It's nice to be able to sit down and knock off the little nagging TODOs here on the site. That said, I'm hoping to be able to make some big changes, soon! We'll see what my schedule allows.</p>

    <div class="post e-content">
<p>
  <i><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">Jonathan Prozzi</a> and I have challenged one another to make a post about improving our websites once a week. This is me getting back on the train!</i>
  <br />
</p>
<p>In a previous site update I wrote about setting up a <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/03/29/161441/">system to notify me</a> whenever my site received <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/">webmentions</a>. Essentially, this meant that I could now get notifications on my phone and desktop whenever somebody interacted with my site, such as: replying to one of my posts on their own site, retweeting or favoriting one of my posts, or even RSVPs to my Facebook events.</p>
<p>One thing I didn't super like about this system is that it used the Pushbullet service which, while great, is not under my control.</p>
<p>I've been running a <a href="http://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> chat server at home for a while now. I primarily use it to chat with people in my household in IRC channels. I use a really nice client for Matrix called <a href="https://about.riot.im/">Riot</a>, which runs in the browser, but is also available on Android and iOS, and is capable of sending notifications about chat events, which I have found really handy.</p>
<p>Recently, I've added a chatbot to my Matrix server named <a href="https://hubot.github.com/">Hubot</a>, thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/davidar/hubot-matrix/">Hubot-Matrix adapter</a>. Hubot is super neat because it is fairly <a href="https://hubot.github.com/docs/scripting/">easy to script up new behaviors</a>, and it has nice built-in support for the web - both for making web requests, but Hubot also runs a server for <i>accepting web requests</i>. Once I realized this, it occurred to me that I could replace my previous notification system that uses Pushbullet with one that goes through Hubot.</p>
<p>First, a note on security. Exposing a chatbot's HTTP listener interface to the great wide internet comes at some risk! I made sure to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I run Hubot behind a firewall, so no plain HTTP traffic can come directly across the internet.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Using another home server, I set up nginx to act as a secure HTTPS proxy, using a certificate from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> to encrypt all traffic that goes over the internet.</li>
  <li>I decided that any behaviors I write for Hubot that use the HTTP listener will use some kind of secret token to ensure that the request is valid. I don't want spammers blowing up my chatrooms!</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided that the bot should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Allow a user to request webmention.io notifications for a given site into any room.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Generate and store a "callback secret" to work with webmention.io's Web Hook system and tell the user the URL and callback secret to configure over on the <a href="https://webmention.io/dashboard">Webmention.io Dashboard</a>.</li>
  <li>Accept HTTP requests from webmention.io at something like &lt;HUBOT_HOST&gt;/hubot/wmio/notify</li>
  <li>Verify that the request contains the callback secret</li>
  <li>Generate a nice text summary of the notification based on its contents</li>
  <li>Send the notification to the room that the user was in when they made the follow request.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  With that in mind, I began learning lots about <a href="https://hubot.github.com/docs/scripting/#testing-hubot-scripts">testing</a> <a href="https://amussey.github.io/2015/08/11/testing-hubot-scripts.html">Hubot scripts</a>, refreshing myself on <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">Coffeescript</a>, and so on.
  <br />
</p>
<p>I am now happy to introduce this first (janky) release of my Hubot Script, <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/hubot-webmentionio-notify">hubot-webmentionio-notify</a>!</p>
<p>Once installed, you can start a conversation with your hubot and ask it to follow a site:</p>
<pre>
  you&gt; hubot wmio follow mycoolsite.biz
  <br />
  hubot&gt; @you OK! Use this as your Web Hook: &lt;HUBOT_URL&gt;/hubot/wmio/notify
And use this as your callback secret: 1a2b3c4d5e6f7890000
</pre>
<p>The string "mycoolsite.biz" can actually be anything and should be something easy to remember in case you want to unfollow notifications later. Hubot doesn't check incoming mentions against it at the moment.</p>
<p>You can enter the URL and callback secret in the Webmention.io dashboard, and future webmentions will be sent to your Hubot and output into the room of your choice.</p>

  <figcaption>Notification example - a user on Twitter mentioned my Twitter handle in a post there.</figcaption>

<p>I don't know how useful <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/hubot-webmentionio-notify">hubot-webmentionio-notify</a> will be for other folks at the moment, but I am excited be getting these notifications via services that I control. I look forward to building more fun things with Hubot!</p>

    <div class="post e-content">
<p>Inspired by <a href="http://eddiehinkle.com/article/2017/03/viewing-webmentions.html">Eddie Hinkle's recent post about viewing webmentions</a>, I decided to improve the way I display webmentions on my site.</p>
<p>TL;DR, my site now pulls attempts to recognize single-emoji comments and display them as a "Reaction".</p>
<p>Slightly longer version - my site uses <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmention.io</a> for handling webmentions, and I use <a>brid.gy</a> to backfeed interactions from Facebook to my own site. The way brid.gy handles Facebook reactions other than the standard "like" is a little quirky - they show up in <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmention.io</a> as a "reply" with a single emoji as the "content".</p>
<p>Using the Ruby <a href="https://github.com/jollygoodcode/twemoji">twemoji</a> library, my site checks the "content" of a reply against the emoji index and, if the content is a single emoji, pulls it out of the usual "reply" display and puts it in a facepile. The emoji itself is shown as an icon in the corner of the little face image.</p>

  <figcaption>Example of some ❤️ reactions from Facebook</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While I was at it, I cleaned up a lot of my webmention-handling template to make things much clearer. This will make things easier for folks that want to re-use this code when I (eventually) release this as a Jekyll plugin.</p>
<p>Tonight is a <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-04-05-homebrew-website-club">Homebrew Website Club night</a>, but Baltimore is not having another official meetup until <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-04-19-homebrew-website-club#US_East">April 19th</a>. Still, I wanted to get something done to continue my deal with <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">Jonathan</a> to post something <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> related at least once per week.</p>

  <i><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">Jonathan Prozzi</a> and I have challenged one another to make a post about improving our websites once a week. I&rsquo;m a little late with this one!</i>
</p>
<p>I recently added support for <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/03/22/003710/">displaying mentions</a>, such as likes, reposts, comments, etc. from around the web that refer to the posts on my site. One thing the update <b>didn&rsquo;t</b> do is catch another type of mention, such as when someone mentions me in a tweet (<a href="https://twitter.com/DnDSVU/status/846544496728965122">example</a>). These get fed to my website by <a href="https://brid.gy/">brid.gy</a>, but weren&rsquo;t displayed anywhere.</p>
<p>So, I created a <a href="https://martymcgui.re/mentions/">/mentions page</a> for displaying these mentions. In the future, when a post mentions my homepage, the result will show up on the mentions page.</p>

  <figcaption>Screenshot of the Recent Mentions page, including some tweets that mention @schmarty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>My mentions still don&rsquo;t yet update in real time - they are compiled into my site whenever I make a new post. That&rsquo;s coming up in the future, but I <b>have</b> taken one more step towards real-time interactions with notifications!</p>
<p><a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a>, the service that I use for accepting and storing webmentions, has a <a href="https://indieweb.org/webhook">WebHook</a> option that can notify your site whenever a new webmention has been received. I wrote up a simple Python service using Flask that will listen for these messages from webmention.io and send them to me via <a href="https://pushbullet.com/">PushBullet</a>, a notification service that I&rsquo;ve been using for a while for other projects.</p>

<p>Congrats and have a Webmention! I love that you have a roadmap.</p>

<p>Something like <a href="https://indieweb.org/PubSub">WebSub (formerly PubSub)</a> would be great for triggering a notification when a new Webmention arrives, without having to poll!</p>

    <div class="post e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/">Webmentions</a> are one of the most interesting and powerful technologies floating around the IndieWeb. At their most basic, they sites on the web to interact by sending a notification when a page on one site links to a page on another. When combined with machine-readable metadata like <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2">microformats2</a>, they enable really neat social interactions between sites, feeding back likes, comments, bookmarks, shares, event RSVPs, and plenty more.</p>
<h2>Receiving Webmentions</h2>
<p>A site doesn't have to do all its own Webmention handling, and there are a few services that will handle them for you. I set up my website with the <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a> service back in <i>August 2016</i> (so long ago!) and it's been accepting mentions from other sites since then. And, while there aren't a lot of websites that send Webmentions natively, there are services like <a href="https://brid.gy/">Bridgy</a> which uses Webmentions to <a href="https://indieweb.org/backfeed">backfeed</a> social interactions to my site from sites like Facebook and Twitter. Pretty neat!</p>
<h2>Sending Webmentions</h2>
<p>When I publish a post with a link to a site that support Webmentions, I still need to actually <i>send</i> that notification. I haven't yet built a tool that does that for my own website, but I have been able to make use of <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">Aaron Parecki</a>'s <a href="https://telegraph.p3k.io/">Telegraph</a>, which will take in a link to one of my posts and parse it for outgoing links, find out of the targets of those links support Webmentions, and allow me to send them with the press of a button. It's ridiculously easy to use and has the added benefit of letting me pick-and-choose which links go out as Webmentions.</p>
<h2>Displaying Webmentions</h2>
<p>Webmention.io has been collecting mentions for my site for something like 6 months, but they don't just magically show up on my site! Webmention.io <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io#api">provides an API</a> for fetching the mention data for individual pages, or all mentions for my domain.</p>
<p>My site is built on Jekyll, a static site generator, and I like that so far it doesn't rely on JavaScript for folks to read it. I didn't want to require JavaScript for displaying mentions, so I needed a way to "bake in" my mentions for each post. I was inspired by <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/">Aaron Gustafson</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io">jekyll-webmention_io</a>, but found that I didn't like some of the choices in markup or the way that it stored the mention data, so I went ahead and wrote my own. It's still heavily a work-in-progress, but I do hope to release it for other folks to use once it's more stable.</p>
<p>What works? Let's see!</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2016/12/12/093528/">an example post</a> with some Likes and RSVPs (both "yes"es and "maybe"s):</p>
<figure>

<p>And <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/03/17/133511/">an example post with some replies</a> backfed from Facebook:</p>
<figure>
  <img class="img-responsive" src="https://media.martymcgui.re/3d/01/bf/2a/de0a04bfde5dbdb259462c912c4b3609b7ec98918f05003707be149e.png" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>All of these are being displayed with the data that Webmention.io provides with its API, and there are some types of post that I would like to handle differently such as the ❤️ above (which was a Facebook "heart" reaction), and I'd like to include a JavaScript enhancement that will show any new mentions, so they aren't sitting in "limbo" until I make a new post.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm really excited to finally be showing these on my site! I think Webmention is a pretty critical part of bringing the "social web" into the IndieWeb and back out of the silos. I am grateful to all the folks that have made this possible with their work on standards and tools!</p>
