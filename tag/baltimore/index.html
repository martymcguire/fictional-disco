<p>Baltimore's second <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/09/20/125531/">Homebrew Website Club of October</a> met at the <a href="https://digitialharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on October 16th.</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>
  jonathanprozzi.net — Worked today on a post recapping our last HWC meeting, focusing on ideas to get more people involved. For work at DHF, still learning lots of NextJS and ExpressJS. Getting back into writing content!
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  derekfields.is — Been a while! Last week in Minnesota for some networking. Met some cool people and talked to some companies, including <a href="https://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a>, which was part of <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/">Open Baltimore</a>. Also got back into bullet journaling after being away for a while. Working on legal and client-finding stuff for his freelance work.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  pulianas.com — Also been awhile since he's been to an HWC! Moved all his sites to HTTPS. His podcast (overanalyzed.fm) is now on iTunes, so he added that link to the site. Also tried to track down an official Overcast button but hasn't found it yet. Recently in San Jose for API World. Very little talk about building APIs and more about pitching specific products/services. Did learn a bit about microservices and case-studies of moving to them. Did some general maintenance on his WP site, and has been working on his own plugin for podcasting on WP.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  martymcgui.re — Been heavily porting his site from Jekyll to Hugo. Has had some fun porting things that he did as Ruby plugins for Jekyll into crazy Go template logic, like generating permashortlinks in <a href="http://tantek.pbworks.com/w/page/19402946/NewBase60">NewBase60</a>. Also had some fun setting up a new CSS Grid display for photos in posts with lots of them (<a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/10/06/144700/">example</a> which apparently only works in Firefox). Also, after some struggling with his image proxy setup (because Hugo templating doesn't support HMAC signatures) is trying out <a href="https://cloudinary.com/">Cloudinary's</a> free tier for his image-resizing needs.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Podcasting on WordPress is... a pain. Apple Podcasts refused to accept their feed due to http vs https issues and that was hard to track down.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.wooji-juice.com/products/ferrite/">Ferrite</a> for audio editing on the iPad. Alec edits his podcasts there now. Some hiccups with the noise-cancelling and auto-levelling features being too-aggressive.</li>
  <li>Recording setups. <a href="https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti-nano/">Blue's new Yeti Nano</a> looks cool.</li>
  <li>
    FF and Chrome starting to support the new dialog element. Maybe cool, maybe terrible?
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-10-03-homebrew-website-club">first Homebrew Website Club of October</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on October 3rd.</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> — No updates since last time for his personal site. Was burned out after a lot of frustration with Gatsby + WordPress headless. Got to the point of feeling helpless and like he couldn't figure out how to progress. Started porting to <a href="https://zeit.co/blog/next">Next.js</a> and has some renewed energy because he is making progress and enjoying it.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Went to <a href="https://indieweb.org/2018/NYC">IndieWebCamp NYC</a>! Didn't do anything new for his site, but did manage to write a <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/10/02/155150/">post full of project ideas</a> that he came away with. Really interested in using free services like <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> (for server-side processing), <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> (static file hosting), and <a href="https://cloudinary.com/">Cloudinary</a> (make thumbnail images from those giant originals) to make IndieWeb building blocks that people without coding experience could combine to make their own sites. Currently thinking of building a <a href="https://indieweb.org/media_endpoint">Micropub Media Endpoint</a> that handles dynamic image resizing to see how this approach works.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ideas from the IndieWebCamp NYC Organizer's meeting about "messaging" for Homebrew Website Clubs. The name is often confusing or off-putting for newcomers, and oddly self-selecting for those that "get it". Thinking about rebranding to "Indie Web Meetup" – evokes "independent web" and a meetup is more inviting than a "club" which might have membership requirements.</li>
  <li>Talked a lot about how many folks who come to HWC are WordPress users and how we might do better by them if we made it more clear that we are here to help them power up their WordPress sites.</li>
  <li>Or even go a step further and simply offer to get people started with or improve their existing personal site. If we can get people to the meetups, no matter the skill level, we can get them started: sign-up for micro.blog to get going right away, put a simple static HTML page up on glitch or GitHub, dive into WordPress, etc.</li>
  <li>First steps may be to think of it more like an open hours help desk. The "price" of getting help can be to write up all the steps followed, as a way of documenting steps for future folks who might need it. The goal would be to have folks come and actually leave with something accomplished.</li>
  <li>
    Also talked about difficulties with estimating the limitations of tools before you invest a bunch of time in learning to use it and understand it deeply. Jonathan's experience with Gatsby was a prime example – ultimately he needed it to do something it didn't support well, but it took a lot of frustration to find out that the issue was with the tool being a bad fit for the problem.
    <br />
  </li>

<p>Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-09-18-homebrew-website-club">first Homebrew Website Club of September</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on September 18th.</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> — Has been travelling and getting married and had lots of time to think about things! Not to work on them, though. Catching back up on things like Gatsby pages for Digital Harbor Foundation. Feeling some maintenance pains now with Gatsby's GraphQL queries pulling HUGE amounts of data from a WordPress backend – about a 5 minute process for each site build. Upgrading to Gatsby 2 would also require a bunch of changes that he isn't wanting to do. Also, something in the Gatsby build process just broke, without him making any code changes. Wishing now he had built the site in <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>, which uses REST over GraphQL. For his personal site, he is thinking about how much effort he wants to put into things. He typically uses his personal site as a way to learn new technology, but is now wary of force-fitting things that aren't a good fit. Maybe tweaking his current WordPress site would be a better use of time than rewriting the site. Particularly since he hasn't posted since July.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://rhearamakrishnan.com/">rhearamakrishnan.com</a> — Not much new on her personal site, since it's working well for her purposes. Posted some new stuff she made over the summer, including a micro chap-book called <a href="https://ghostcitypress.com/2018-summer-microchap-series/it-makes-more-noise-than-i-thought-it-would">It Makes More Noise Than I Thought It Would</a>. Been working on other summer projects, like writing poems on postcards for people. Photographing and typing those up to make a mini-collection. Wants to build something on <a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine</a>, if she can include a form so people can write letters back to her. She's gonna write out the adventure as she wants it and then think about what kind of interactivity she'd like from readers. Thinking about designing a mini-course for DHF around Twine for students to build stories around it.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Hasn't really made much progress on any personal or IndieWeb projects since the last HWC meeting. Had a couple of out of town trips and projects that were good and fulfilling experiences, like going to <a href="https://www.improvutopia.com/iu-east/">Camp Improv Utopia East</a>. Those experiences highlighted that maybe he is feeling burned out about some IndieWeb things! For example, he has been letting the <a href="https://martymcgui.re/podcasts/indieweb/">This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition</a> slip more and more each week and finding it hard to focus. He's trying to figure out what to do for the upcoming IndieWebCamp NYC, which he is excited about, but feeling a bit overwhelmed by project ideas, things he should be doing to help organize, etc.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>https://twinery.org/ is great for creating interactive stuff - and it seems like the output is plain HTML? So it should be possible to add a form from some service like <a href="https://formspree.io/">Formspree</a> or <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> to an exported project, if the tool doesn't offer exactly that kind of thing.</li>
  <li>Dealing with burnout and feeling stuck on things. Sometimes it helps to get energized by doing something else. Sometimes doing those other things really highlights that you have energy, just not for those things you're burned out on!</li>
  <li>Principle of Least Power is another big thing, here. Jonathan and Marty have both been struggling with projects where the tooling or the plumbing may be taking all the energy available.</li>
  <li>Semantic HTML and CSS can do so much, now. We looked at this <a href="http://www.mattzeunert.com/2017/10/30/javascript-free-todo-app.html">CSS-only TODO MVC proof of concept</a>. Talked about HTML definition lists, summary/details tags, figure/figcaption, and more.</li>
  <li>
    Talked about the <a href="https://sonniesedge.co.uk/talks/dear-developer">pyramid of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and the inverted pyramid of overbuilt JS-dependent frameworks</a>.
    <br />
  </li>

  Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-08-22-homebrew-website-club">second Homebrew Website Club of August</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on August 22nd! 
  <br />
</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>
  shawngrimes.me — Shawn has been working on <a href="http://teamruby.dog/">teamruby.dog</a>. Specifically, collecting content. It's a new WordPress site. Thought about Squarespace because of ease of maintenance but can't justify the pricing. Also trying to find a way to post some 360 panorama photos from a recent road trip through 19 states.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  martymcgui.re — Finally started the grueling work of translating his site's data from Jekyll into Hugo. It involved writing lots of little scripts to do things like maintain redirects for old date-based URL slugs, RSS for podcast feeds, and other plumbing. Next up is to port his existing templates over, which should be a big process. Also started a tribute site to his cat Nitro at nitro.rocks. Hoping to make it an IndieWeb-project by getting folks to contribute fun cat memories by posting to their own site and syndicating to nitro.rocks.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Ways to showcase 360 photos. Ricoh apps can (could?) post interactive panoramas to Facebook/Twitter. Marty posted some interactive panoramas on his site back in 2016 (<a href="https://martymcgui.re/2016/08/28/114014/">example</a>), but isn't super happy with the experience.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>RSS (and Indie) readers</li>
  <li>Webmentions and notifications</li>
  <li>
    Badging (and politics)
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>

  Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-07-25-homebrew-website-club">second Homebrew Website Club of July</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on July 25th!
  <br />
</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://derekfields.is/">derekfields.is</a> — Derek wanted a couple new rules for sharing time, today. First, find and share a site with some cool tech that you like. Second, talk about why you're into web development. He showed off a demo of using the browser Gamepad API w/ a Playstation dual-shock 3 controller. It showed button state changes, including analog states for buttons and joysticks. Been thinking about lots of ideas lately but missing some focus. Looking at productivity hacks to focus more. Notices when he's not focusing, now trying prompts to figure out why he's distracted and get back on task. Derek is into web development because it changes rapidly and requires focus to keep learning. Been working on his VueJS class and it's been going well until today. His accountability buddy is on a trip.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> — Been working on work stuff. Built a single-page app w/ Gatsby for deploys of some Digital Harbor Foundation content for use in remote schools with intermittent internet connections. Pulls course data from the central DHF WordPress and deploys it as a package on Netlify. Ran into his first deploy issues with Netlify due to case-sensitive filesystems (which he doesn't experience on his Mac dev machine). Been really inspired by the <a href="https://sustywp.com/">Susty WordPress theme</a> which can deliver WordPress pages in ~6KB, compared with most themes, which are very bloated. Jonathan is into the web because of the problem-solving aspects of it, but also because it allows creative expression and productivity.</p>
<p><a href="https://zach.oglesby.co/">zach.oglesby.co</a> — New! Welcome, Zach! Recently switched his Known-powered site to <a href="https://cleverdevil.io/">Jonathan LaCour's</a> overview page (w/ location info and other nice things), but it doesn't have a representative h-card, yet, so working on that. Also working on making his read posts more compatible with <a href="https://indiebookclub.biz/">IndieBookClub</a>. In terms of "Cool Tech", just had occasion to use Bootstrap for the first time, which was interesting. Zach is into web development because there are so many ways to do things on the web, you can play and tinker with different things you might not have otherwise.</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://pulianas.com/">pulianas.com</a> — New! Welcome, Alec! Has had this website for a while, originally as a portfolio, now as a WordPress site that powers his Micro.blog. Been working on a new site for a podcast, <a href="http://overanalyzed.fm/">Overanalyzed</a>, also WordPress. In terms of "Cool Tech" - likes <a href="https://eddiehinkle.com/">Eddie Hinkle's website</a>. Also, webrings "seem pretty cool". Isn't a web developer professionally, but likes how it makes publishing easy. Really also likes the concept of owning your own content, bringing his stuff in from Twitter. Sees his online identities as layers: website is most personal, Twitter next, and Facebook is sanitized.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Been working on the <a href="http://baltimoreimprovfestival.org/">Baltimore Improv Festival</a> website, a static site generator called <a href="https://github.com/ruhoh/ruhoh.rb">Ruhoh</a> that doesn't really "exist" as a project anymore, though the code and gems are still out there. Needs to spend time on the webrings site. In terms of "Cool Tech", likes this recent <a href="https://youtu.be/vs34f9FiHps">"Even More CSS Secrets" talk</a> from <a href="https://lea.verou.me/">Lea Verou</a>. Marty is into web development because it is an amazing way to share content that anyone can access from anywhere in the world! "Can it be done on the web?" is an interesting, if sometimes difficult, lens to see the world through.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.unicornriot.ninja/2018/hope-conference-criticized-for-allowing-far-right-harassment/">Code-of-Conduct issues with the recent Hackers On Planet Earth conference</a> that Marty attended last weekend.</li>
  <li>Deploying things on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>! Marty tried his first Netlify site during quiet writing hour, as a potential host for the <a href="http://baltimoreimprovfestival.org/">Baltimore Improv Festival</a> website, which is currently on an old shared host.</li>
  <li>Tools for writing VueJS (and using Visual Studio Code for it). Like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vue+snippets+for+vscode&amp;atb=v51-3_a&amp;ia=software">Vue Snippets for VS Code</a>, linting tools, and <a href="https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/">Sarah Drasner</a>'s CSS tricks articles about VueJS.</li>
  <li><a href="https://brutalist-web.design/">brutalist-web.design</a> and the principle of least power when building things.</li>
  <li>Talked about how mobile designs can be better than "full" desktop site designs. E.g. <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> vs. <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/home">mobile Twitter</a>. But also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> vs. <a href="https://m.facebook.com/">mobile Facebook</a> vs. <a href="https://mbasic.facebook.com/">"basic" mobile Facebook</a>, the last of which has no Javascript!</li>
  <li>Getting around town. E.g. the new Bird scooters that are here in Baltimore.</li>
</ul>

Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-07-11-homebrew-website-club">first Homebrew Website Club of July</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on July 11th! 
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> — Been building static HTML/CSS layouts for fun! <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/learning/fun-with-html-css-layouts-part-one-layouts-1-3/">Some</a> <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/learning/fun-with-html-css-layouts-part-two/">examples</a>. Also started practicing turning those designs into layouts in <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a>. Had a usability testing call w/ the folks from <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a> that turned into a great discussion about how to better build community starters.</p>
<a href="http://www.dariusmccoy.com/">dariusmccoy.com</a> — Was having some issues w/ his site, which is hosted on AWS. He is thinking about wiping his instance and starting a new one, since he has lost track of some of his passwords. In a tricky spot because AWS doesn't offer any tech support for free tier users. Talked about switching to Digital Ocean or something simpler but will have to balance his budgets to justify the costs.
<p><a href="http://derekfields.is/">derekfields.is</a> — Been taking a Udemy course on VueJS. Before that has been working on a schedule for developing his website. Has a friend doing the same and they mutually keep each other on track to spend a certain amount of time on developing their skills and sites. It's kind of working!</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Brought a bunch of stickers and other fun things home from IndieWeb Summit! Had a great time seeing folks he met last year and meeting new folks. Lots of great discussion sessions, hacking projects, wild ideas, and more. He really needs to write it up on his site! His hack day project also desperately needs to be written up – it's an IndieWeb-style web ring, available at <a>🕸💍.ws</a> ! This week he added support for <a href="https://indielogin.com/">indielogin.com</a>, which lets people sign in using their own websites by <a href="https://indieweb.org/RelMeAuth">setting up only a couple of links</a>.
  <br />
</p>
Other discussion:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/2018">IndieWeb Summit</a>! Marty went and loved it. Next year would love to bring more folks from HWC Baltimore, and travel assistance is available. We'll work on it.</li>
  <li>
    Marty met <a href="http://ewy.me/">Jared Ewy</a> of <a href="https://name.com/">name.com</a> at the Summit and talked about all the cool work DHF does teaching youth to build websites, the upcoming Web Shop, hosting HWC and IWC Baltimore, etc. Jared gave him a bunch of codes for free domains and some hosting discounts to benefit that work, so we discussed lots of ideas!
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Some possibilities: give Web Shop youth employees incentive to work on their own projects, outside of paid jobs, to learn more about building their own sites. Host a special Homebrew Website Club that's a 2-hour jam for new folks who don't have a domain yet to get set up with a website. Host a longer "Build Your Website Day" (maybe in coordination with a <a href="https://twitter.com/sdepolo/status/1011739362122334208">multi-city Drag Queen Build-a-Website Day</a>?)</li>
  <li>What would an IndieWeb "starter pack" look like for a quick "you have a domain but no money" way to get started? GitHub looks good for skill building for folks that want to get into web development someday because it's mostly managed by hand. Netlify looks pretty good for this because they offer hosting, flexible static site generation, SSL for HTTPS, and the NetlifyCMS. They also support some features like building your own webhooks on JavaScript, which could eventually be used to handle common IndieWeb building block endpoints (IndieAuth, Micropub, Webmention, ...) Because they run all the stuff for a given site from a git repository, it's possible to take a site from Netlify and set it up elsewhere if their offerings change.</li>
  <li>"Packages" for a getting started workshop. E.g. "what will you get at the end + what will you need to learn along the way." Static HTML/CSS on GitHub could get a portfolio site done. For $5/mo a <a href="http://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> site can be hosted on a custom domain and requires no Git/GitHub wrangling. <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> hosting is also $5/mo and brings a ton of features, interactivity, and community.</li>
  <li>Talked about VueJS passing React in terms of number of stars on GitHub, and speculating why that is. For example, VueJS can be a lot easier to dip your toes in and get started without a complicated build toolchain.</li>

  Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-06-13-homebrew-website-club">first Homebrew Website Club of June</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on June 13th!
  <br />
</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://derekfields.is/">derekfields.is</a> — Thinking about ESP8266 + WebAR to make, e.g. a painting with AR overlays in mobile browsers. Working on CSS Grid stuff for his site, now. Trying to be consistent.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> — Mainly been working on stuff for <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">DHF</a>, but it overlaps w/ personal projects. Working on a "headless WordPress" setup as a data source for a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> or <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next</a> static site that can be taken to schools w/ super slow internet. Been learning how to use Gatsby – the GraphQL queries for WordPress have been tricky. Got it working on his own site first, then managed to get a handle on how to pull lessons for specific courses from the set of all courses. Now digging into more GraphQL (like debugging w/ <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a>) and issues like differences in how WordPress handles whitespace (processing newlines into paragraph and break tags) vs stuffing the content into a React component (no special whitespace processing by default). For personal stuff, feels like Gatsby + headless WP is too heavy. Interested in an IndieWeb-starter version of the Gatsby starter site, which doesn't even have semantic HTML at the moment. Also looking into WordPress + Next... next, because it seems simpler.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.dariusmccoy.com/">dariusmccoy.com</a> — Went to <a href="https://www.nomcon.org/">NOMCON</a> and helped build the <a href="https://www.wethebuilders.com/projects/8">We the Rosies sculpture</a>. Will be working on a new project for DHF for managing 3D Print Shop.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Installed <a href="https://grant.codes/">grant.codes</a>' <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postrchild/ecifafdialoohbgngelfbjplgbhiklpm">PostrChild plugin for Chrome</a>. It shows Edit Post buttons on his posts and makes the content there editable via Micropub and it is very neat! Also showed off his <a href="https://indiebookclub.biz/">indiebookclub.biz</a> <a href="https://indiebookclub.biz/users/martymcgui.re">profile</a>. Added support for read posts to his site to support it and is now converting old read posts (which were just notes of the form "📕 Finished Reading: ...") into this new form. Has ideas for additions to indiebookclub like URLs for books and authors, tags, text content, and backfeeding entries from his site to complete his profile. Will be dropping in his Goodreads data next.</p>
<p><a href="https://bouhmad.com/">bouhmad.com</a> — Been implementing a speedtest-like app on a new site for Baltimore City to gather data by census block and compare. Part of his new(ish) project to establish a mesh network for the city!</p>
<p>
  Other discussion:
  <br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://indieweb.org/2018">IndieWeb Summit</a>! I think next HWC Baltimore may be happening during IWS demo time. Maybe it'll be streaming here!
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://jgregorymcverry.com/">Greg McVerry's</a> work on IndieWeb and WordPress and education. His most recent post on <a href="https://jgregorymcverry.com/can-we-build-a-static-site-generator-for-indieweb/">building a course management system in IndieWeb-style</a> feels very much in line with what Jonathan has been working on.</li>
  <li>"Headless" Micropub CMS - what would these look like? Jonathan is interested in <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page">Microformats2</a> as the storage format for posts, courses, and other data, and <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub">Micropub</a> seems like the way that MF2 data gets shipped around for creating/editing posts. But most Micropub clients are built for creating (and rarely editing) very specific kinds of posts.</li>
  <li>Comparison to Netlify CMS - which is built around Git and flat files. Netlify can get a list of all your posts by listing files in Git. A Micropub-based CMS would need to query a list of all posts, with filters like post type, tags, ...</li>
  <li>GraphQL queries over MF2 properties??</li>
  <li>Facebook's API changes have <a href="https://snarfed.org/2018-06-07_turning-off-facebook-for-bridgy">caused Bridgy to stop working</a> for backfeeding reactions and comments, and Publish will stop working in August. Jonathan thought his site configuration was broken as he wasn't getting backfed comments and likes anymore. Basically: Facebook has shut out the IndieWeb. This feels like a huge problem (for the IndieWeb)! How are people working around it? Are they? This may help usher IndieWeb folks out the door for Facebook, but it almost completely stops people who want to be in that in-between space.</li>

<p>It's been a while! Again! We cancelled our previous meetup due to weather.</p>
<p>Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-05-29-homebrew-website-club">second Homebrew Website Club of May</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on May 29th!</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dariusmccoy.com/">dariusmccoy.com</a> – Playing with Squarespace because he expects to have youth using it for the upcoming Web Shop launch at DHF. In ~3 weeks! He's trying to clone the existing <a href="http://printshop.digitalharbor.org/">DHF 3D Print Shop website</a> in it, but finding it a bit restricting. Playing w/ some CodePens for nice animations/transitions but having trouble getting those into the Squarespace editing tools. Wants to use them for within-page links.</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://derekfields.is/">derekfields.is</a> – Been struggling w/ goals on personal website stuff. Has been applying for webdev jobs, though! Waiting to hear back. Has been working on his startup idea - an LED backpack for biking. It's controlled by a microcontroller and he wants it to serve a webpage over WiFi so you can control it from your phone without installing anything.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – Spent time tonight writing a post because he hasn't in a long time. The post includes shaming himself for not writing posts. Writing up his experiences from a recent conference where DHF was receiving an award. Building apps with GatsbyJS which are PWAs that work offline, so the content he writes for DHF can work for people who have viewed them even if the internet goes down.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – "Launched" his GIPHY-backed GIF posting app <a href="http://kapowski.schmarty.net/">Kapowski</a>. After feedback from last time, made it work without requiring logins (making it usable by people who aren't all wired up with IndieAuth on their sites). Thinking about ways to progressively enhance Kapowski, such as saving favorites that can be viewed offline, offline sending with posts going out when the internet comes back, etc. Been going all in on micropub for his personal notes that exist on a private site. Used <a href="https://github.com/Inklings-io/selfauth">selfauth</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Zegnat/php-mintoken">mintoken</a>, <a href="https://github.com/skpy/micropub">skippy's micropub server</a>, <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/spano">spano for media</a>, and built a new <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html">nginx auth_request</a> service that uses IndieAuth and an access control list to allow only him to view the private posts. Hoping to clean that up and release it someday soon. Also started first steps for another long-term micropub-related project to assist sites that support micropub for creating and editing posts but don't want to build their own infrastructure for syndication. It's called <a href="https://glitch.com/~fanatical-wound">"POSSE Party"</a>, and currently it's a <a href="https://indieweb.org/manual_until_it_hurts">manual-til-it-hurts</a> Micropub editor that lets you manage mp-syndicate-to and syndication properties for posts. Someday he hopes to make something that can use bridgy or silo.pub to automate syndication for people whose sites don't do that.</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    LED mounting strategies for backpacks. Big diffusers make for good looking LEDs but surface mount parts make things easier to mount.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Jonathan's experiences at the conference. His takeaways from talks about making human-centered technology. E.g. "context is everything, a perfectly engineered span is useless, but the Brooklyn bridge connects people". He's thinking a lot about common themes around technology that works *for* humans. For example, so many people don't have internet all the time!</li>

<p>It's been a while!</p>
<p>
  Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-05-01-homebrew-website-club">first Homebrew Website Club of May</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on May 1st!
</p>
<p>In celebration of 5/01 aka HTTP 501 Not Implemented, we'll talk about things we wish that our websites did, but that they don't yet do.</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – Been working on lots of other projects. Did two work projects with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org">GatsbyJS</a>. One is deployed but not public. Learned a lot about GraphQL. Working on a handbook for youth training and trying to get a <a href="https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms">netlify CMS</a> hooked up to it. Also did a small <a href="https://vuejs.org/">VueJS</a> project to learn a bit more about it. Wants to use the WordPress API with some of these technologies on his site. 501 desire: going headless for his WordPress site because he is obsessed with PageSpeed.</p>
<p><a href="http://maryreisenwitz.com/">maryreisenwitz.com</a> – Been working on sites and content for work. Trying to capture FAQs about working at DHF in preparation for a couple of dozen new youth to start working here. Finds that good explanations uncover the need for more good explanations and lots of branching docs, as different youth employees will have different responsibilities. Excited about having this resource be a website. Wants to include a youth "face book" of names and faces so the new folks can recognize one another and existing staff. 501 desire: wants a web store on her main site, because Etsy is becoming frustrating.  </p>
<p><a href="https://bouhmad.com/">bouhmad.com</a> – Set up SSL via <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">LetsEncrypt</a> and loves it, the easiest SSL setup he has ever done. Started a blog post about intrusion detection, kept adding to it, and pushed it out last week. Working on a piece about a bug bounty he recently collected, working with the company in question. 501 desire: a mailing list signup and a Hugo-driven RSS feed to a Mailchimp mailing list.</p>
<p><a href="https://grant.codes/">grant.codes</a> – Visiting as he drives across the US! Restructuring his site's data on the backend. Was using something like mf2 data, but now moving to pure mf2. Broke a bunch of features doing that, so going through to fix those now. 501 desire: homepage mentions! He accepts but doesn't store or display them.</p>
<p><a href="https://eddiehinkle.com/">eddiehinkle.com</a> – Working on leaving Facebook! Has made a sign-up form for friends/family to sign up for monthly (for now) newsletter. Has a complex (too complex?) tagging for tech, personal, family to generate three RSS feeds. These can be subscribed to in any combination (so 9 possible feeds), and the emails will combine all posts in the desired feeds. The feeds themselves reuse markup that he wrote to make posts look good on micro.blog. Just posted monthly review for March and hopes to keep doing summaries. Uses the "last month" view on his site for the raw data. 501 desire: automated webmentions! His site is Jekyll-based, so that's a can of worms. Loves using Indigenous for the quick responses from the indie reader, but then has to go back to his site and manually send webmentions.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – Traveled recently and checked in everywhere using Swarm, which feeds back to his site (sorry anyone following feeds)! Really enjoyed it, but slightly regrets giving Swarm all that data. Thinks an app could use the Swarm venue API to do Micropub and skip creating the checkins on the server. 501 desire: unlisted posts! Really wants to make photo gallery posts where each photo has a permalink but only the gallery shows up in feeds. Eventually private posts, too.</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Grant's automated year-in-review feature. Cities visited, hours of TV, distance traveled (tracks GPS constantly).
  </li>
  <li>Ways to do hidden posts. Categories. Unlisted or private as a property.</li>
  <li>Email lists vs "followers" on social media and the feeling of reach.</li>
  <li>Facebook's reaction when you start mass deleting friends. Mary once deleted close to 700 people and found that the interface started rearranging itself, putting people back in the list where it's easy to mis-click and re-add them as a friend.</li>
  <li>Deleting your posts from Facebook. Does it affect the algorithm? What threats does it eliminate?</li>
  <li>Family signing up for email blasts: would they reply? What if those replies went to an address that turned them into a comment on your site? If their email address is in your nickname cache, you can show their name and photo and url.</li>
</ul>

  Baltimore's <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/04/02/161711/">first Homebrew Website Club of April</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on April 10th
  <br />
</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – Demoed an as-yet-unnamed (maybe: kapowski) "GIF Reaction" Micropub client. It's <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/garrulous-smile">currently available on Glitch</a>. It supports <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a>, searching for GIFs via the <a href="https://developers.giphy.com/">GIPHY API</a>, then posting those as the "photo" property in a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub">Micropub</a> form-encoded request. It also supports <a href="https://indieweb.org/in-reply-to">in-reply-to</a> functionality, putting the "reaction" into "GIF Reaction", though there's no UI for that, yet. He made an <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/04/10/193815/">example reply post</a>, but <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/indieweb/hwc-2018-03-07-wrap-up/#comment-439">Jonathan's post</a> doesn't seem to support <a href="https://indieweb.org/photo_reply">photo replies</a>. 🤔 Also fixed up some <a href="https://indieweb.org/metacrap">metacrap</a> for his <a href="https://wehavetoask.com/">podcast site</a> so sharing looks better on Facebook and Twitter.

<p>
  <a href="http://rhearamakrishnan.com/">rhearamakrishnan.com</a> – Working on a redesign of her site. Making good use of view-source on sites that she likes for inspiration. Working on a mixed media art project with post cards that direct you to a website that contains coordinates to a geo cache containing an actual letter.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – Been doing lots of work stuff that overlaps with personal web interests. Working on his wedding page. It's now up on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and uses their form collection for RSVPs.</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The new <a href="http://killerqueenarcade.com/">Killer Queen</a> 5 vs 5 arcade game recently installed in Baltimore at <a href="https://www.holyfrijoles.net/">Holy Frijoles</a>.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Baltimore zine culture (apparently <a href="https://atomicbooks.com/">Atomic Books</a> considers carrying local zines).</li>
  <li><a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine</a> for creating interactive poetry and fiction. It outputs a bunch of HTML and CSS (and maybe JS) that can be hosted anywhere.</li>
  <li>The Netlify static site model of separating content management, storage, layout and rendering, and file hosting.</li>
  <li>The difficulty in evaluating "frameworks" like React and Vue based on their low-level merits. Looking at community and availability of higher-level components might help more.</li>
</ul>

  After a postponement due to snows on the first day of spring, Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-03-27-homebrew-website-club">second Homebrew Website Club of March</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on March 27th. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – Talked about his <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/reflection/learning-and-project-update-march-11-2018/">recent experiments with Netlify and JAMstack</a>. Had been researching static site hosting services for a while and found a lot of hype. After playing w/ <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> he feels like it lives up to the hype! Was specifically interested in a static site generator called <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>, which uses the <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> front-end framework to render content.</p>
<p><a href="https://derekfields.is">derekfields.is</a> – Been building a blog section for his site on a static site generator called <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>. Found the theming stuff to be confusing and time-consuming, but has something working. Will eventually replace the theme with his own as he understands it more. Really likes the Hexo admin composer and compared with the editor for <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>. Feels like the features help him write. Also setting up a <a href="https://now.sh/">Now.sh</a> tiny server for a subdomain to host <a href="https://vuejs.org/">VueJS</a> apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://brksavage.com/">brksavage.com</a> – Set a goal to do something creative and post about it every month. Did a big project for February (created a desk-sized piece filled w/ the word "bored"). Now writing it up and thinking about ways to make it easier to publish in the future.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dariusmccoy.com/">www.dariusmccoy.com</a> – Still building up momentum on his Wordpress site. Had a scare that he was locked out of his admin but got back in. Now that he has a working site, he is setting goals for himself about what he wants that site to have and how he wants to present himself there.</p>
<p>
  Robert (<a href="https://gnostech.net/">gnostech.net</a>) – Working on owning his data. Has a <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> service set up on his domain, where he can access all his data from his phone and more. Has been taking lots of notes about his home set up (Nextcloud, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>, ad filtering firewall at home, and more). Wants to build a blog to share both how-tos on what he has set up and how, but also the way he decided on his particular needs. Has been using <a href="https://www.nas4free.org/">NAS4Free</a> to have more control over his home network storage.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – Is finally back after missing several HWCs. He has definitely missed them! Talked about the need for indie readers that allow reading and posting reactions to personal sites all in one. Demo'd <a href="https://alltogethernow.io/">Together</a>, and <a href="https://monocle.p3k.io/">Monocle</a> <a href="https://indieweb.org/Microsub">Microsub</a> clients as well as Aperture for Microsub server to handle all the nitty-gritty of fetching and parsing feeds.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Derek started us off with a really nice warm-up. We took turns with each person sharing compliments/thanks/encouragement about things people are working on and/or doing for and/or learning from one another. (This was seriously really nice).
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    JAMstack (Javascript, APIs, Markup). Name was coined because some "static" sites have lots of dynamic functionality.
    <ul>
      <li>Jonathan gave a demo of Netlify serving pages from a GitHub repo. Talked about how lots of different workflows can be used to manage content (e.g. Ghost, Netlify CMS, etc) without worrying about the final step of compiling the source into HTML and serving those static pages. Netlify has tons of features in the free tier (SSL with Let's Encrypt, support for forms, and more).</li>
      <li>Q: How do they make money? A: Great question! They're advertised all over the place in the web design world. Maybe consulting? For example, they did a huge redesign for Smashing Magazine.</li>
      <li>Q: Do we have to use GitHub? A: That's all Jonathan has played with so far, but they probably support other source control services.</li>
      <li>Q: What content goes in the Git repo? A: The source content, templates, etc. E.g. the output of "hexo init".</li>
      <li>Q: How does the DNS setup work? A: Netlify gives you IP addresses and you point A records at them. Same way you would for a Digital Ocean droplet or other virtual server.</li>
      <li>With custom domains, pulling content from GitHub, and tools like the (also free) Netlify CMS that ease editing, this could be a strong competitor for e.g. Wordpress.com sites, barring some initial setup pain.</li>
      <li>Was able to replace FormSpree service with Netlify's free form handling service. He can see the submitted form data by logging into his Netlify account.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Talked about recent creepy Facebook news and <a href="https://cleverdevil.io/2018/freeing-myself-from-facebook">efforts like cleverdevil's to escape it with our content intact</a>. Marty was inspired by that to grab his Facebook content with <a href="https://github.com/danburzo/fb-export">fb-export</a> and the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/downalbum/cgjnhhjpfcdhbhlcmmjppicjmgfkppok">DownAlbum extension for Chrome</a>.</li>
  <li>If Facebook goes away or runs into issues, what happens to projects like React or their other open source projects?</li>
  <li>Would a giant like Amazon step up? What would an Amazon social network look like?</li>
  <li>If Facebook actually "falls" (however unlikely), would another centralized social network "win"? Probably!</li>
</ul>

  <br />
</p>
<p>
  Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  jonathanprozzi.net – Productive 2 weeks! Has a personal notes site running on Hugo on a subdomain after some adventures with git publishing hooks and a bug with themes that was causing it to render only as XML. Set up a separate site with Hugo and <a href="https://revealjs.com/">Reveal.JS</a> and might be interested in that for IndieWeb-related learning activities going forward. Has been tracking everything he is writing, taking notes in his personal notes site as he goes so he can either clean them up for real posts, or just publish the notes. Worked tonight on more activity content on his personal notes site. Troubleshooting microformats on his main site WP theme. Also interested in <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">GatsbyJS</a> plus a WordPress backend... maybe? Also working with Gulp to make a build tool for P5.js sketches.
  <br />
</p>
<p>dariusmccoy.com – Tonight moved his domain from WordPress.com to Hover. Waiting on that to finish so he can set up new hosting and move his site in general off of WordPress.com onto a WordPress.org site which has more flexibility. Thinking about the direction of his site - resume / portfolio, or blogging, or posting his photography. Could blog personal projects, maybe sports blogging but worried about trolls.</p>
<p>derekfields.is – Set up his GitHub pages site to serve from his custom domain. Also put up a <a href="https://medium.com/@DJFalcon23/guardrails-vr-from-a-microcontroller-e765c2874c3f">post about serving A-Frame virtual worlds from an ESP8266 microcontroller</a> on Medium. Working on a PESOS copy of his post back to his site. Wants to work on a couple more posts for next time.</p>
<p>bouhmad.com – Working on bringing his site back up. Something went wrong on the virtual server running it and he is reinstalling and reconfiguring things. Has a blog post ready to go once the site is back up. (He got it back up before the end of HWC!)</p>
<p>martymcgui.re – Been working on IndieWeb-ifying some project websites, most recently <a href="https://ghostparty.today/">ghostparty.today</a>. It's a single HTML page hosted on Neocities that his improv partner created at IndieWebCamp Baltimore. It's an experiment in nesting microformats and permalinks, making use of links with anchors (<a href="https://ghostparty.today/#show-2018-02-14">example event</a>, <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/01/31/224122/">example RSVP</a>). Also added mf2 markup to the site for his D&amp;D livestreaming show (<a href="https://dndsvu.rpg.academy/episodes/cs04p1/">example</a>, <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/02/02/130233/">example reply</a>) so he could reshare things on his site. Is excited about making a micropub server for the Neocities site as a goof, probably running on <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. Something like "IndieWeb like it's 1999".</p>
<p>Other things: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Falcon Heavy test launch happened today and wow! We could not find a reference for the projected final orbit of the payload (a Tesla with a mannequin wearing a SpaceX space suit)
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbSwFU6tY1c">livestream video</a> was interesting. It offered multiple camera views, switchable with a "Switch Camera" button in the YouTube UI. The main view was the public facing talking-head discussion, telemetry displays, etc. The other was a static camera with audio direct from mission control.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Transferring domains from WordPress.com is interesting. Apparently the registrar is listed as wildwestdomains.com?
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Managing DigitalOcean droplets is hard when you lose your SSH private keys.</li>
  <li><a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> as a fun way to sketch in code. <a href="https://neocities.org/api">Neocities has an API</a>.</li>
  <li>Really clever onboarding process on Glitch. Log in with your GitHub and it shows a welcome page with "Start New Project" and "Resume Coding" buttons. Even if you have never used Glitch before, clicking "Resume Coding" will take you to a new Hello World project. Nice!</li>
  <li>DigitalOcean recently(?) updated their pricing so that lower tiers are much better! You have to walk through a process to stop each droplet, resize it, and start it back up.</li>
  <li>The Brackets editor has a <a href="https://github.com/torcado194/Brackets-Confetti">Confetti</a> plugin and it is very eye-catching.</li>
  <li>.meme is a pending TLD??? Also talked .bot premiums on shorter domain names.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/blog/2470-introducing-security-alerts-on-github">GitHub Security Alerts</a> now send out weekly emails. Maybe only for some accounts or types of vulnerability, but Marty has been receiving them about some old projects.</li>
  <li>JAMstack, the attractive bits about "reusable APIs" the dangers of those same APIs belonging to third-parties out of your control.</li>
</ul>

<p>Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-01-23-homebrew-website-club">second Homebrew Website Club of January</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on January 23rd.</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Been catching up on things since IndieWebCamp! Spent tonight writing the <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/01/23/191137/">first of several wrap-up posts</a>. Also finally got the weekend's <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/01/23/120410/">episode of This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition</a> up this morning, ~3 days late. Planning to write more specific wrap-ups, open up some old Micropub and IndieAuth python projects he needs to update.</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> — Recently finished a draft of a 45-60 minute activity for new folks to HWC to register their first domain. None of tonight's attendee's need a domain, so we'll punt on that for next time. Spent the time tonight setting up a notebook.jonathanprozzi.net subdomain to be a publicly accessible version of the Hugo site that he set up recently to take notes. He used it over the weekend at IWC Baltimore and now wants it available on his phone. He also subscribed to all the IWC Baltimore attendees on <a href="https://woodwind.xyz/">Woodwind</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://derekfields.is/">derekfields.is</a> — Working on VR world project where the server is a microcontroller with sensors that can directly manipulate the VR world. Dealing w/ issues serving an A-Frame VR web app from his nodemcu microcontroller. The nodemcu serves a big opaque string for content and he wants to have it load A-Frame and other third-party resources from a CDN. The trouble is that when your computer is connected to the nodemcu's access point, there is no access to the internet. He is looking at another possibility of serving those minified scripts directly from the nodemcu.</p>
<p><a href="http://angelosresu.me/">angelosresu.me</a> — Just noticed his website is down, oops. Not been working on his site much. Has been working on setting up his first OAuth implementation at work.</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/2018/Baltimore">Baltimore had our own IndieWebCamp</a>! It was great! Videos are available now for all Saturday sessions as well as Sunday morning intros and afternoon demos.</li>
  <li><a href="https://snarfed.org/1-million-webmentions">1 Million Webmentions</a>!</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/">WebSub is a W3C REC</a>!</li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/indieauth/">IndieAuth is a W3C Note!</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Lots of discussion about what IndieAuth is, vs RelMeAuth, PGP</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>W3C governance is interesting! And confusing!</li>
  <li>Showed off Woodwind as an example of IndieAuth dance. Also got Jonathan set up with Micropub via Woodwind so he can send replies.</li>
  <li>Open Graph Protocol, microformats</li>
  <li>Moving the idea of computing out of the default idea of a screen and keyboard/mouse/touch and a bunch of storage and computing right in front of you into more interesting paradigms like little internet-connected microcontrollers, virtual worlds.</li>
  <li>The idea of needing indie readers to start consolidating how people can read and respond to IndieWeb content as easily as on silos. We may all be asking <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">Aaron</a> for accounts on Monocle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-12-12-homebrew-website-club">December meetup for Homebrew</a> Website Club met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on December 12th.</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – Went to <a href="https://2017.indieweb.org/austin">IndieWebCamp Austin</a>, and it was great! Some notes on that below. <a href="https://2018.indieweb.org/baltimore">IndieWebCamp Baltimore</a> is scheduled and people are RSVPing and booking plane tickets, so he is very excited! The schedule now appears to be locked in and it's time to market it hard. Also demo'd the way he shows multiphoto posts on his site with CSS Grid (<a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/12/10/194648/">example</a>). 2018-01-01 commitments progress: super happy with IWC Baltimore progress, expects to cut is close with <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/11/26/162135/">his commitment</a> to move his site to Hugo by 2018.</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://brksavage.com/">brksavage.com</a> – Been working on a crash course in WordPress, HTML, kind of overloaded on it. Tonight worked on another project because of writer's block.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://djfalcon23.github.io/">derekfields.is</a> – Been geeking out on <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/">codrops</a> – really nice visualizations and animations on the web with SVG, WebGL, and more. So pretty! Adding a blog page to his site (by hand). Researching how to incorporate Ghost into his site. Started a <a href="http://www.100daysofcode.com/">100 Days of Code project</a>! Similar to <a href="https://indieweb.org/100DaysOfIndieWeb">100 Days of IndieWeb</a>, the goal is to get an hour of coding done every day and tweet your progress. Missed a couple of days over the weekend, but enjoys sharing out his progress and the community support. Would like to have a buddy to support each other. 2018-01-01 commitment progress: working on apostrophe and a cloud service to host it, downloaded Ubuntu tools for Windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://bouhmad.com/">bouhmad.com</a> – Site is down at the moment. Needs to get it back up and on HTTPS. Wants to do a blog post on experiences as being a dual full-time student and full-time employee out of high school, and the "full college experience". 2018-01-01 commitments: wants to get that blog post up, would like to commit to blogging at least once every two weeks in the new year capturing projects as a resource to others but also daily life as an archive for his future self.</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/reflection/2018-01-01-commitments/">2018-01-01 commitments</a>: little progress on his pre-2018 commitment but still thinks he has time. Really wants to get his local WordPress + git setup going soon. A new near term goal: RSVP to IWC Baltimore!
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other Things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Bitcoin! Coinbase! GDAX! How unreal the value is right now and how unusable it all is.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/2017/Austin">IndieWebCamp Austin</a>! Marty went and loved it. We went looked at the <a href="https://indieweb.org/2017/Austin/Schedule">Sessions Grid</a> and talked about each one at a high level.</li>
  <li>Talked about the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/">WordPress Post Kinds</a> plugin and how it might be useful to have a series of blog posts that explains how to get the most out of this plugin, tying that into details about the different types on the wiki and so on.</li>
  <li>Talked a lot about IndieWebCamp Baltimore. It's shaping up to be very exciting! Aaron Parecki got the event and wiki pages looking good, so now we want to start getting the word out everywhere.</li>
  <li><a href="https://wordpress.tv/2017/12/10/brianna-privett-the-story-of-your-life-using-wordpress-as-your-memory-warehouse/">Brianna Privett</a> talk about using WordPress as a life log.</li>
  <li>Ways to put WordPress development into git, like <a href="https://roots.io/">Bedrock/Trellis</a>, putting the whole site in version control, organizing child themes, etc.</li>
  <li>CSS Grid! It seems like magic!</li>
  <li>2017 was an amazing year for HWC Baltimore. Thanks to everyone who made it a success. We can't wait to see everyone again and made an awesome 2018!</li>
</ul>

  Baltimore's <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/11/13/120157/">second November 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on November 15th.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – Is back after lots of travel and writing a post about that, including a roadmap of getting back into things. Archived several posts from his old Hugo site into his new WordPress site. One of his 2018-01-01 goals is to practice posting status updates to his site instead of Facebook.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://brksavage.com/">brksavage.com</a> – Bought a new domain for a blog a couple of months ago, transferring it to BlueHost now. Been looking over old content. A 2018-01-01 commitment: small goal - write something small and publish it before end of year.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://derekfields.is/">derekfields.is</a> – Working on getting a JavaScript-based CMS called <a href="http://apostrophecms.org/">apostrophe.js</a> working for his site. Probably going to host it on Heroku. Also learning the Windows subsystem for Linux, because developing on Windows "doesn't feel right" since he's not using .NET or similar.</p>
<p><a href="https://bouhmad.com/">bouhmad.com</a> – Working on a first post to go up tonight! Realized the original scope for his "first post", which was going to compare multiple host-based intrusion detection systems, was going to take weeks! So, he's starting off with one, then planning to get back to it after he graduates (hopefully!) in December.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – Been working on a new way to store and display webmentions on his site. Currently has one site that pulls them from webmention.io with JavaScript, and one site that polls webmention.io for new mentions every time it is compiled by Jekyll. Started building a webhook in Python but has now moved to PHP because it should be simpler. </p>
<p><a href="https://dariusmccoy.com/">dariusmccoy.com</a> – Just got started with his domain, just a landing page. Wants to add more content to it.</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    IndieWeb <a href="https://indieweb.org/2018-01-01-commitments">2018-01-01 Commitments</a>.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tessalt/echo-chamber-js/blob/master/readme.md">echo-chamber.js</a> - a fake commenting system that stores comments in the browser, so the commenter (and no one else) can see what they are saying.</li>
  <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/2018/Baltimore">IndieWebCamp Baltimore 2018</a>! We talked about what an IndieWebCamp is and how it is structured.</li>
  <li>IoT and the IndieWeb (mentioned the <a href="https://indieweb.org/2017/iw4hw">IndieWebSummit session on IndieWeb for Hardware</a>).</li>
  <li>Twitter and Facebook business models and how they benefit from outrage.</li>
  <li>IndieWeb generations, specifically the way that participating in the IndieWeb right now almost requires you to be a developer.</li>
  <li>The creepiness of Amazon Key.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Thanks to everybody who came out! We look forward to seeing you at the Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center for the next one! We'll be meeting again on <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-11-29-homebrew-website-club">November 29th</a>.

  Baltimore's <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/10/23/224415/">first November 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on November 1st. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://bouhmad.com/">bouhmad.com</a> – Been working on a big post about security issues. Also, collecting resources for an <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Charm-City-Net-Tech/events/244116726/">Equifax-breach-themed CryptoParty in November</a>, which will also go on his site.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://djfalcon23.github.io/">djfalcon23.github.io</a> – Buying his dream domain (TBA once it is registered). Been reading lots about getting into tech industry, dealing w/ impostor syndrome. Planning to turn some of these into notes and/or posts on his site when it is up.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – Posted up the <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/10/31/230504/">last IWC NYC 2017 interview (with Tantek)</a>. Would like to have one per week to put up, so will bring his mic to next HWC Baltimore, and may start asking people in IRC to do interviews over Skype, Zencaster, or similar. Also just reached the <a href="https://wehavetoask.com/episodes/2017-10-31/">100th episode of his comedy podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Other things.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Worries about Net Neutrality and the upcoming FCC proposals to break it by allowing pay-for-access fees to publishers. We looked at resources like <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/">battleforthenet.com</a> and a <a href="https://twitter.com/coton_luver/status/924306977458593792">video from Congressional Democrats about the issue</a>.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Podcasts about tech. Derek has been trying to find podcasts about cutting-edge tech, but been frustrated. For example, Friends Talk Frontend has good content, but he finds the hosts annoying. Adam recommend Talk Python to Me because it is funny and timely, focusing on new tech. Marty recommends the Contrafubilists because it is kind of an anti-cutting-edge tech podcast with very thoughtful hosts that take apart the marketing speak behind technology trends.</li>
  <li>Also got off into the weeds about good story-driven podcasts. 😅</li>
  <li>Talked about a theoretical "disruptive student" detection system that uses computer vision, motion detection, face recognition, to log "overactive" students and generate reports. Generated a lot of interesting discussion about unintended consequences of technologically "simple" systems.</li>
  <li>Talked about the problems of trying to digitize the rules of complex human systems and the problems of measuring outcomes, determining what "just" algorithms looks like, etc.</li>
</ul>

  Baltimore's <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/09/25/174529/">second October 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on October 4th.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Recently <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/10/17/205701/">posted about his IWC NYC hack day project</a> - showing subtitle and caption tracks for audio files in the browser by marking them up as a video element. Showed off his new personal site, a note-taking and planning site with an audience of one. It lives on his laptop and on a protected Tor hidden service so it can be read from his phone. Also been working on porting his podcast website to Hugo, learning how fragile his micropub server is about mapping URLs to flat files on the server.</p>
<p><a href="http://bouhmad.com/">bouhmad.com</a> — Started a new job recently, so been working to find time to work on his new site. Wrote an outline and a list of resources about what the site will be about and what content will be on it. Hoping to publish in the next two weeks!</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://maryreisenwitz.com/">maryreisenwitz.com</a> — Our venue host for the evening! Been writing a lot of stuff and working to organize it. Outlining story points for a narrative piece, consists of lots of dream pieces, which she has been logging for a few years. Been organizing those in Google Keep, cataloging and tagging them by time. Found it really interesting to look over her dream notes for this time past year. Also finding searching incredibly useful. "When did I dream about a horse? There are two dreams!"
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://rhearamakrishnan.com/">rhearamakrishnan.com</a> — Has a set of projects she wants to finish before updating her website. One of them is a podcast that will require lots of collaborative elements, so been planning that.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://angelosresu.me/">angelosresu.me</a> — Has been on the job search and realized he needed a website. It's currently a programming demo of a CAD app that uses <a href="http://paperjs.org/">Paper.js</a> and supports boolean operations over primitives.</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We talked about aligning audio/video content and content in a web page, like <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/learning/regex-golf-with-peter-norvig">this course on O'Reilly</a>. Would be useful for DHF's learning system courses. Could also be fun to have This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition show previews of the pages being discussed as they are being discussed.</li>
  <li>We discussed capturing notes with the lowest friction tools then moving them into more useful/durable systems later.</li>
  <li>We talked about podcasting tools. Dedicated recorders for in-the-field recording, Audacity for editing.</li>
  <li>We talked about the recent announcement from Adafruit's founder/owner/engineer ladyada finding herself <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/10/18/facebook-update-removed-facebook/">locked out of her Facebook account</a> with no apparently recourse. This led to general discussion of silos and monopolies, systems that are secretly bad for you because they stalk you or share you or your contacts' data, systems that are directly bad for you like Candy Crush and other addictive apps.</li>
  <li>Talked about some decentralized systems, like <a href="https://maidsafe.net/">MaidSafe</a> (decentralized p2p filestore, incentivized w/ a cryptocurrency), and Beaker's new <a href="https://louis.center/p2p-social-networking/">decentralized Twitter-alike Rotonde</a> (decentralized p2p websites, host it yourself or pay someone to mirror).</li>
</ul>

<p>Baltimore's <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/09/25/172140/">first October 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on October 4th.</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Went to IndieWebCamp NYC last weekend! Had a really great time (that he really needs to write up). Figured out how to show closed captions / subtitles on audio content (and needs to write that up). Recently decided that Jekyll was slowing him down too much and decided to jump to Hugo. First steps there - use a sacrificial website to learn on that is much simpler, in this case the <a href="https://wehavetoask.com/">We Have to Ask Podcast</a>. Also showed off <a href="http://v6.robweychert.com/">Rob Weychert's</a> website as one that impressed him from IWC NYC due to the really nice typography, spacing, layout.</p>
<p><a href="https://djfalcon23.github.io/">djfalcon23.github.io</a> — Added a new slideshow feature. Can now show a model slideshow of past projects. In true HWC fashion, he pushed this feature live during the demo. Will be adding similar modal displays for PDF documents and videos.</p>
<p><a href="http://lizboren.art">lizboren.art</a> — Been changing her art portfolio site. It's hosted on <a href="http://artstation.com/">ArtStation</a> which has a pretty affordable "pro" level with good editing tools. She's been happy with it for now. Slightly more problematic is that her .art domain was registered on her behalf by her school and now she doesn't know how to get access to manage it. We tried to use the WHOIS info to track down who to contact at the controlling registrar.</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> — Been working on a site for work at Digital Harbor Foundation. They are relaunching blueprint.digitalharbor.org educator resource portal. They've been working on a clear structured landing page for people that are not registered for it, as well as cleaning up navigation for users who are registered. It's a WordPress site and they've been moving their content into "Sensei", a WordPress add-on for education content from WooCommerce.</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    We talked about doing design research and taking inspiration from sites that are similar to what you're working on.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Talked about the different approaches needed when working on content and structure versus working on making something attractive.</li>
  <li>Went around talking about pet peeves about the web: bad graphic design, not having an obvious login button, sites that use social logins (e.g. GitHub or Twitter) when they don't work, crucial interactions in modals that aren't clickable on mobile, surveillance and adware crap.</li>
  <li>Talked about the recent "alternative to ads" where the page runs a JavaScript bitcoin miner, and how wasteful this is in terms of energy vs. coins earned. Maybe all machines need mining ASICs? Talked about other alternatives like Brave and Flattr, compulsory licensing models and <a href="http://craphound.com/category/est/">Doctorow's Eastern Standard Tribe</a>, paywalls, paying for things with Bitcoin in general, money as an abstract concept.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to everybody who came out! We look forward to seeing you on <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-10-18-homebrew-website-club#Baltimore_MD">October 18th</a> at the Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center!</p>

<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – Set up bridgy on his new WordPress site since last time. Working on a post detailing his move from Hugo to WordPress. Hoping it serves as documentation to help with outreach to other folks who already use WordPress, or folks looking to start a new personal website. Also hoping the bridgy publish works, since this is his first time posting with it.</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://maryreisenwitz.com/">maryreisenwitz.com</a> – Working on web content for a DHF digital fabrication course that starts next week, starting with Autodesk Fusion 360. It's organized as "lessons" on a WordPress site at learn.digitalharbor.org.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://bouhmad.com/">bouhmad.com</a> – Prepping to launch his personal site at that URL. Has a local development version, written in Hugo. Will be posting about security research.</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://rhearamakrishnan.com/">rhearamakrishnan.com</a> – Working on her portfolio website, which mostly links to writing she has had published elsewhere. Wants to make sure all the outgoing links still work, update the look. Also has a lot of visual content like zines that she wants to display in an appealing way. Currently publishes via GitHub Pages, facing a learning curve making styling changes, but is sticking with it and wants to keep things simple.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – Super excited that we have had a year of HWC Baltimore meetups! Looking forward to more outreach in the year ahead, finding ways to reach people who don't yet know that they want to be part of the IndieWeb. On his personal site, been working on a per-month archive view. Playing both with Jekyll plugins to generate the pages and with learning CSS Grid to do the layout, because it's new and shiny. The slowness of Jekyll is really tempting him to jump to Hugo, despite knowing it will be a huge pain.</p>
<p>
  Shawn Grimes – Working on web content for a different DHF learning system called Blueprint. Currently focused on things like that rather than his personal website.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    We talked about some of the pros/cons of static site generators vs WordPress. E.g. security needs, ease of posting, etc. etc. etc...
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>We talked about Hugo being good for archiving content like old Evernote notes. You can make an archive that is more browsable/searchable than the Evernote exports and doesn't require Evernote.</li>
  <li>Talked about ways of taking and organizing notes, differing needs (e.g. need to write down something quickly, so a mobile interface is key). Some different options came up, like <a href="https://laverna.cc/">laverna.cc</a>, <a href="https://ulyssesapp.com/">ulyssesapp.com</a>.</li>
  <li>Talked about reasons not to store things on clouds like Evernote and Dropbox, targeted advertising. Tools to prevent surveillance such as <a href="https://better.fyi/">Better</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/focus/">Firefox Focus</a>.</li>
  <li>Talked about some general intro-to-IndieWeb stuff, how it got started, building blocks like POSSE and webmentions, and making progress through small incremental steps.</li>
</ul>

<p>We're very happy to have reached the milestone of a year of (nearly-) regular meetings! Thanks to everyone who has come out to be a part of these meetups so far.</p>
<p>
  We hope you'll join us again on for another HWC Baltimore meetup at Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center! Our next meetups will be <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-10-04-homebrew-website-club#Baltimore_MD">October 4th</a> followed by another on <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-10-18th-homebrew-website-club#Baltimore_MD">October 18th</a>.

  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/08/25/000915/">Baltimore's first September 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on September 6th. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="http://jonathanprozzi.net">jonathanprozzi.net</a> (Jonathan) – Stepped through Digital Ocean tutorials with nginx and has a fresh new WordPress site running for his personal site. Has a SemPress theme and the IndieWeb plugin and will be working through all those next. Happy to already have working rel-me stuff and being able to log into the IndieWeb wiki. Looking forward to helping others get set up as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://djfalcon23.github.io/">djfalcon23</a> (Derek) – Thinking about getting a ".is" domain. Likes the idea of using it with paths like ".is/cool", ".is/making". Started a new site for his light-up bicycling backpack, using his personal portfolio site as a template.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> (Marty) – Started a dedicated podcast-oriented page for <a href="https://martymcgui.re/podcasts/indieweb/">This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition</a>. Did some refactoring of his site to make it work reasonably. Next up is adding subscribe buttons for Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, and more. Did some research into other podcasts' website subscribe button designs.</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We also talked about Digital Ocean has a hosting provider. We like that they provide a lot of guides, in addition to being very affordable.</li>
  <li>
    Talked about geo-based TLDs as being more stable than ".ninja" and others. Reviewed some podcast subscribe button designs on a few sites.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Talked about recent video games and 8-bit aesthetics.</li>
</ul>

  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/08/07/114608/">Baltimore's second August 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on August 23rd. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p>
  jonathanprozzi.net (Jonathan) – Had been working on a wedding site with Hugo and making progress. Got really frustrated with adding image galleries, which required a lot of extra tools. Realized that he could accomplish the same thing in WordPress really quickly. So, spent quiet writing hour starting over in WordPress. At this point, just wants to have it done, rather than spending time learning something new along the way.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  martymcgui.re (Marty) – Since last time has been thinking a lot more about delivering transcriptions with audio content. Did more experimenting with Audiogram, and found the <a href="https://github.com/BBC-News-Labs/audiogram">BBC's fork</a>, which supports subtitles and transcription editing, but also depends on a lot of private BBC infrastructure out of the box. Is now able to get timestamped transcripts by combining an audio file and long-form text transcription using a tool called <a href="https://github.com/lowerquality/gentle/">gentle</a>. Then by feeding that into a hacked-up copy of the BBC's Audiogram can generate video with hardcoded subtitles. Here's an <a href="https://media.martymcgui.re/10/ef/8f/99/b181f11e199c00112d921955fd2bf5d78254ea0a9fef2a118aa37c30.mp4">example from the most recent This Week in the IndieWeb</a>. Pretty neat! Also experimenting with providing a text transcript of the audio newsletter along w/ the audio via a simple HTML details/summary elements with an iframe. <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/08/19/140447/">Example here</a>.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We talked about use cases where static sites are great (simple project sites) and not-so-great (lots of media files).</li>
  <li>We also chatted a lot about the future of the This Week in the IndieWeb audio edition, making the content more accessible, making it more engaging.</li>
  <li>
    We also talked about being aware of when it makes sense to use manual tools vs. trying to creating automation, such as the tradeoffs with using "manual" video editing tools vs. tools like Audiogram.
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>

  djfalcon23 (Derek) – been on break of web dev to learn Android dev. Set up a schedule to work on his portfolio site on Wednesdays. Has a WIP site up at <a href="https://djfalcon23.github.io/">djfalcon23.github.io</a> with a landing page. Next steps are modals to display the content for the main sections, a carousel for other photos. After that, it's time to make a project page for his LED backpack with brake and turn signals for cyclists.
  <br />
</p>
<p>jonathanprozzi.net (Jonathan) – started a new Hugo project for his wedding which will be his "Hugo project" so he can feel free to move his main site over to WordPress. Bought and set up a new domain and a new Hugo project for that.</p>
<p>polarfire.net (Isaac) – In town visiting Marty. Spent quiet writing hour tracking down the source for his Pelican-based site which was last updated 2014 and getting the dependencies installed. Likes starting side projects, so might port it to Hugo. Many of his projects are related to owning his data on a home server. Next major step there is setting up backups w/ duplicity.</p>
<p>martymcgui.re (Marty) – Did some reading from the folks at <a href="https://twitter.com/meetgretta">@meetgretta</a> (formerly signl.fm) and learned about a tool called <a href="https://github.com/nypublicradio/audiogram/">Audiogram from WNYC</a>. It generates videos from audio files for sharing on silos that have good video sharing support but not audio, which is most of them. Made an <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/08/07/113251/">example post with an interview with Ben Werdmüller from the This Week in the IndieWeb Podcast</a> that is syndicated to <a href="https://twitter.com/schmarty/status/895423872115146754">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marty.mcguire.54/videos/vb.1292103610/10210046638744486/">Facebook</a>, <s>and Mastodon</s>.</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    djfalcon23 showed a cool use of parallax on <a href="http://www.firewatchgame.com/">firewatchgame.com</a>.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Talked about automated captions for audio, showed off some of the <a href="https://medium.com/matter-driven-narrative/signl-fm-on-making-a-social-media-interface-for-podcasts-9e1d16667f1">Gretta demos</a>.</li>
  <li> djfalcon23 pointed us to <a href="https://twitter.com/noopkat">@noopkat</a>, who streams live development and was recently working on similar tools.</li>
  <li>martymcgui.re did a quick demo of the micro.blog iOS app for posting tonight's photo</li>
</ul>

  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/07/13/123031/">Baltimore's second July 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on July 26th. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="http://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – After setting up a local WordPress dev site last time, revisited his existing Hugo site. The Hugo documentation has received an update, so he walked through making a new site from scratch, found out the theme configuration for his old site was not working as Hugo docs suggest. Wants to make sure his Hugo experience isn't colored by a misunderstanding on his part. Feels stuck between wanting to improve his existing stack and workflow vs spending the time to convert everything to WordPress.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – Inspired by IndieWeb Summit session on Events, made a couple of improvements to event posts on his site. First added a "subscribe to calendar" link to his front page and "Add to Calendar" links on his individual event pages so folks can get calendar reminders of his indie events. Second, added a webmention submit form ("did you mention this? post the URL here") to all his posts, which should make it easier to send indie RSVPs to his indie events. Set up a new iPod Touch with the micro.blog iOS client and has used it to post a couple of photos to his site without much trouble and a nice (if somewhat quirky) workflow. Has been changing up some of the microformats markup on his posts to try and make them work well with both Woodwind and Atom feeds generated by Granary.</p>
<p>We talked about a writing app called <a href="https://ulyssesapp.com/">Ulysses</a>, which Jonathan has been using for work and finds the writing is a faster process than his previous workflow with Markdown. Also talked sunk cost of working with the tools we already have working vs spending the time to set up and learn something new that might (eventually) be better. A tempting goal is to moving from posting to our personal sites and enjoying IndieWeb benefits for ourselves to making ourselves into ambassadors for folks in Gen2/3 by adopting WordPress + plugins.</p>

  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/06/28/212819/">Baltimore's first July 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on July 12th.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="http://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> - finished up a post from the last HWC meetup about his thoughts on switching from Hugo to Wordpress. Had it all written, but forgot to publish it - largely because of the multistep Hugo publishing process! Says this illustrates that the process overhead of using the tool is clearly getting in the way. Started a local Wordpress install to get things going. Before switching - wants to figure out how to preserve the Hugo version of his site as a snapshot (maybe on a subdomain?). Cares about both the content and the presentation of it. Also wants to figure out another project to encourage him to learn Hugo.</p>
<p>Darius - started in on a portfolio-style site on Wordpress. Has a theme he likes but is struggling with customizing it due to its documentation. Thinking about what he wants to put on the site. Also found out that a Wordpress site that he manages for work was hacked by spammers, so worked on fixing that.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> - since last time, cleaned up microformats around his likes, reposts, bookmarks to add explicit p-name and e-content, so readers like Woodwind will show something more reasonable than the "implied" names. Hasn't been working much on his site, so spent some time on his <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Martymcgui.re">IndieWeb wiki user page</a> to read through and re-organize his itches to choose something to work on. Inspired by the <a href="https://indieweb.org/2017/events">2017 IndieWebSummit session on events</a>, started work on a Jekyll generator plugin that will create iCal .ics files for his event posts, so he can put "add to calendar" buttons on his indie events.</p>
<p>We chatted about the Battle for the Net, Wordpress security, <a href="https://indieweb.org/WordPress_Outreach_Club">Wordpress Outreach Club</a>, intricacies of how the various IndieWeb Wordpress plugins and theming operates, and more!</p>

<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/06/06/135528/">Baltimore's June 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on June 28th.</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> - Been very busy with work. Wrote a couple of posts since the last meeting. Tonight started a reflective post about his decision to use Hugo for his site vs Wordpress, which he already uses a lot for work. Feels like he has learned a little bit of Go (which Hugo is written in), but mostly has just learned Hugo and felt that's held him back. Interested in the Wordpress API and maybe move his site over because he wants to post more and still learn.</p>
<p><a href="https://eddiehinkle.com/">eddiehinkle.com</a> - Been working on his site rewrite in Angular Universal. Today worked on micropub media endpoint. Is saving files successfully, now needs to add file extensions and return the Location URL. Also been working on <a href="https://indieweb.org/Indigenous">Indigenous</a>, his iOS micropub client. Been switching back and forth between the two as he makes progress or gets stuck on one or the other. Other stuff since last time: adding OwnYourSwarm, OwnYourGram. Having a micropub client on his phone has enabled him to send lots and lots of likes - enough that he decided to move likes out of his main social stream page and treat them as a reply.</p>
<p>djfalcon23 (domains currently expired) - been learning web development on and off for the last year. Now building a portfolio site using Bootstrap and trying out React, but it is a lot. Also trying to (re-)learn Android development.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> - Went to IndieWeb Summit and it was amazing! Added checkins to his site w/ OwnYourSwarm while there because of jealousy of seeing other folks checking in with Swarm. Really attracted to the gamification, but wants to make a checkin client so he doesn't have to give them his data. Also been cleaning up microformats on his site so that reply contexts on other site and in readers like Woodwind look better.</p>
<p>Chatted a bit about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Double-dipping" - choosing side projects that involve technology you already need to use (or learn) for work</li>
  <li>Angular Universal, basically a server-side render of Angular which includes a static rendering of markup as well as all the scripts and data to "hydrate" the page</li>
  <li>
    Saving posts on Facebook and trying to PESOS to a bookmark post, but the Facebook API seems to have those locked down.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Learning React is pretty overwhelming, lots of tooling and stuff up front that doesn't feel connected to a project.</li>
  <li>Guided learning w/ online systems with guided courses like Pluralsight have been really helpful for Jonathan.</li>
  <li>Gamification of Foursquare - coins for photos and random things, comparison with friends, weekly generated summaries with titles like "Weekend Getaways"</li>
  <li>Talked about how some aspects of the "design language" of web sites have converged and solidified several years ago. djfalcon23 likes looking at the designs on the <a href="http://instagram.com/welovewebdesign">welovewebdesign Instagram page</a>. Wants to see more like that in the world.</li>
  <li>Talked about IndieWeb Summit and the videos available, particularly the Wordpress sessions.</li>
  <li>
    Spent a lot of time on the <a href="https://indieweb.org/2017/perweb">Personal Web Sites examples</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Awesome suggestion by djfalcon23 to bring an inspirational website to the next meetings.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/05/12/172008/">Baltimore's second May 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on May 31st.</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net">jonathanprozzi.net</a> - Since last time, did some cosmetic updates to site. Also did a lot of traveling. Catching up now on finishing a series of posts he started at <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/05/10/202154/">last HWC (May 10th)</a>. Now one-and-a-half posts behind his schedule. Wants to stick with consistency of writing something once per week.</p>
<p><a href="https://amyhurst.com/">amyhurst.com</a> - Working on a website for work (something that is usually on her "some day" list). Gathering student questions from emails into an FAQ on a Wordpress site.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re">martymcgui.re</a> - Added JSON Feed to blog.adafruit.com because it was easy and why not? Also talked about webmention notifications in his home Matrix chat server via Hubot. Is interested in more textual/conversational interfaces for things in his life and fewer apps and pages to remember to look at.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metamage.com/">metamage.com</a> (<a href="https://jjuran.org/">jjuran.org</a>) - All sites now HTTPS. A couple are HTTP/HTTPS for classic MacOS clients, others are HTTPS-only. Used PNG/GIF and CSS to make a screenshot of an emulator animate when moused-over (bottom of <a href="https://www.v68k.org/advanced-mac-substitute/">https://www.v68k.org/advanced-mac-substitute/</a>). Some fun browser issues w/ image handling (dithering?) in Safari. His site uses a homebrew Perl static site generator, shared CSS across all his sites. Planning to rework it in the V language.</p>
<p>Chatted about Micropub becoming a W3C Recommendation, including going through <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2017/05/30/1/w3c-micropub">Aaron Parecki's announcement post</a>, which is a very clear walk through of the development process. Talked about <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> as an up-and-coming social platform that supports Micropub out of the box. Talked about the power of social nudges (like "how's that project going?") for making progress on projects. Two of us (jjuran and martymcgui.re) will be at <a href="https://2017.indieweb.org">IndieWeb Summit</a> in Portland later this June and are looking forward to it!</p>

  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/04/21/142337/">Baltimore's April 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on April 19th. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p>jonathanprozzi.net - not been making his weekly posts in challenges with Marty. Inspired by a nearby bookstore closing, realized he had done lots of learning in bookstores over the last ~15 years. New idea for a series of posts cataloging all the things learned in a specific place over the years. Wants to journal the things he is learning on a weekly(ish) basis to build an archive.</p>
<p>brianey.com - been writing up lots of ideas for his blog but not finishing them. Based on that unfinished work, started writing about some new topics on creativity. For example, writing about starting things vs. achieving them. Looking forward to writing those including cute graphics of badgers, (em)barkers, etc. and being inspired by those posts to take on other unfinished posts.</p>
<p>amyhurst.com - working on an FAQ page for all the questions she gets from students seeking to get into the grad programs that she manages. It should be a useful resource for students, but also for her to copy and paste into emails from students who don't or won't read it.</p>
<p>martymcgui.re - brought a bunch of posts from an old blog into his site, including old comments from disqus. Did updates to site plumbing so he can add syndication to his posts after the fact with micropub updates, allowing him to get webmentions and notifications of interactions on Twitter, FB, etc via brid.gy without pulling out a laptop.</p>
<p>We talked about the upcoming <a href="https://2017.indieweb.org/">2017 IndieWeb Summit June 24th-25th in Portland, Oregon</a> and discussed the indie RSVPs on the site. From there we ended up on <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">Aaron Parecki</a>'s site and chatted about the amount of information that is collected and shared, what things we'd like to be collecting for review about ourselves, what things we're comfortable publishing.</p>

  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/03/29/145427/">Baltimore's April 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on April 19th.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p>brianey.com – Been working on some content based on personal notes, which he takes all the time, about things like stuff he's read, etc. Thought about turning ~5 of his notes at a time into monthly lists, but has been writing a lot. Might be more like each note becomes a paragraph-long post. He also manages a newsletter that usually covers one topic, but might automate these new "listy" posts into a collection for the newsletter.</p>
<p>jonathanprozzi.net – Been working on a longer content post, part two of a series that started in March about creativity and code and his personal learning journey. Wants to keep up with post-a-week challenge. Started capturing ideas because he tends to forget topics if he doesn't get started on them. Doesn't want to have long spans of time between posts, so needs a system to keep track of posting as he gets too busy to take big chunks of time.</p>
<p>martymcgui.re – Been working on cleaning up cruft in his site implementation, not a lot of publicly visible stuff. Also been thinking a lot about things that stop him from posting, like not being able to easily syndicate posts while on mobile, and thinking of plans to make it easier. Tonight worked on the first part of supporting micropub edits for his site by working on source queries.</p>
<p>We also had a good discussion about how folks track their projects, keep ongoing notes, nudge themselves to make progress, and more. We talked about tools like Google Calendar and Tasks, laverna.cc, "GTD", and more that I forgot to write down.</p>

  We hope that you'll join us for the next HWC Baltimore on May 10th back here at the Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center! It's an "Off-Week" for the usual HWC schedule. After that we're back on track with another "On-Week" HWC on May 31st!
