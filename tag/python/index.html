  <h1 class="post-title p-name"><a href="/2017/01/26/spano---a-minimum-viable-micropub-media-endpoint/">Spano - a minimum-viable Micropub Media Endpoint</a></h1>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  
  
    
    <div class="post e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/">Micropub</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;an open API standard to create posts on one's own domain using third-party clients &nbsp;and currently a W3C Candidate Recommendation. One of the (semi-) recent additions is the idea of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#media-endpoint">Micropub Media Endpoint</a>. The Media Endpoint provides&nbsp;a way for Micropub clients to upload media files to a Micropub service, receiving a URL that is sent along in place of the file contents when the post is published.</p><p class="">Some of the things I like about Micropub media endpoints include:</p><ul><li>The spec allows the media endpoint to be on a completely separate domain from the "full" micropub endpoint.</li><li>The spec doesn't specify anything about how the files are stored or their final URLs or filenames.<br></li><li>They make it easy to separate the handling of (large) media files from the (presumably much smaller) content and metadata of a post.</li><li>They enable Micropub clients to upload multiple files without creating multiple posts. This makes it simpler to create posts that contain multiple images, like a gallery.</li></ul><p class="">Personally, I wanted a Micropub media endpoint server with a few extra properties:</p><ul><li>It should be able to run completely separately from, and therefore work in conjunction with, any other micropub server implementation.<br></li><li>It should not store duplicate files. If the same file is uploaded twice, the same URL should be returned both times.</li><li>It should not allow overwriting files. If two images of the same name are uploaded, both are kept and receive different URLs.</li></ul><h2>Enter HashFS</h2><p class="">My extra features above essentially describe a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">content-addressable storage</a>&nbsp;storage system. CAS is a way of storing and accessing data based on some property of the actual content, rather than (potentially arbitrary) files and folders.</p><p class=""><a href="https://hashfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">HashFS</a>&nbsp;is a Python implementation of a content-addressable file management system. You give it files, it will put them in a directory structure based on a <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic hash function</a>&nbsp;of the contents of that file. In other words - HashFS can take any file and give back a unique path to that file which will never change (if you later upload a new version of the file, it gets a different path).<br></p><p class="">To add the the fun of HashFS, there is a Flask extension called <a href="https://flask-hashfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Flask-HashFS</a>&nbsp;which makes it easy to expose a HashFS file store on the web via the Python&nbsp;<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>&nbsp;framework.</p><h2>Introducing Spano</h2><p class=""><a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/spano">Spano</a> is a Micropub Media Endpoint server written in Python via the Flask framework which combines Flask-HashFS for file storage with&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/Flask-IndieAuth">Flask-IndieAuth</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/01/26/104730/">introduced earlier</a>) to handle authentication and authorization.</p><p class="">Spano is a server-side web app that basically does one thing: it accepts HTTP POST requests with a valid <a href="http://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a>&nbsp;token and a file named "file", stores that file, and returns a URL to that file. The task of serving uploaded files is left to a dedicated web server like nginx or Apache.</p><h3>Using Spano</h3><p class="">Once Spano has been <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/spano#spano">set up and configured</a>&nbsp;for your domain, uploading is a matter of getting a valid IndieAuth token. IndieAuth-enabled Micropub clients will do this automatically. For testing by hand I like to log in to Quill and copy the access token from the <a href="https://quill.p3k.io/settings">Quill settings page</a>. With token in hand, uploads are as easy as:</p><pre><code>curl -D - -F "file=@myfile.jpg" \
  -H"Authorization: Bearer xxxx..." \
  https://media.example.com/micropub/</code></pre><p class="">Which should output a response like:</p><pre><code>HTTP/1.1 100 Continue

HTTP/1.0 201 CREATED
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 108
Location: https://media.example.com/cc/a5/97/7c/2004..2cb.jpg
Server: Werkzeug/0.11.4 Python/2.7.11
Date: Thu, 26 Jan 2017 02:40:05 GMT

File created: https://media.example.com/cc/a5/97/7c/2004..2cb.jpg</code></pre><h3>Integrating Spano with your Micropub Endpoint</h3><p class="">If you want Micropub clients to use Spano as your Media Endpoint, you need to advertise it. This is handled by your "main" Micropub server using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#discovery">discovery</a>. Essentially, a client will make a configuration request to your server like so:</p><pre>https://example.com/micropub?q=config</pre><p class="">And your server's response should be a JSON-formatted object specifying the "media-endpoint". A bare minimum example:</p><pre>{<br>&nbsp; "media-endpoint": "https://media.example.com/micropub/"<br>}</pre><p class="">In addition to advertising the media-endpoint, your Micropub server must be able to handle lists of URLs in places where it would normally expect a file.</p><p class="">For example, when posting a photo from Quill without a media endpoint, your Micropub server will receive a multipart/form-data encoded file named "photo". When posting from Quill with a media endpoint, your Micropub server will instead receive a list of URLs represented as "photo[]=https://media.example.com/cc/...2cb.jpg". Presumably this pattern would hold for other media types such as video and audio, if you are using Micropub clients that support them.</p><p class="">This particular step has been an interesting challenge for my site, which is a static site generated by Jekyll. My previous Micropub file-handling implementation expected all uploaded assets to live on disk next to the post files, and updating my Jekyll theme and plugins to handle the change is a work in progress. I eventually plan to move all my uploads out of the source for my project in favor of storing them with Spano.</p><h2>Feedback Welcome!</h2><p class="">Spano is probably my second public Python project, so I'd love feedback! If you try it out and run into issues, please drop me a line <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/spano/issues">on GitHub</a>. Or you can find me in the <a href="https://chat.indieweb.org/">#indieweb chat</a> on freenode IRC.</p><p class="">I'd also like to thank Kyle Mahan for his <a href="https://github.com/kylewm/woodwind">Woodwind</a>&nbsp;Flask server application, which inspired the structure of Spano.</p>

  <h1 class="post-title p-name"><a href="/2009/02/20/face-detection-in-static-images-with-python/">Face Detection in Static Images with Python</a></h1>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  
  
    
    <div class="post e-content">
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve been longing to do with my mobile photo-sharing site <a href="http://camura.com/">Camura</a> is to offer image annotations, like objects and faces.Â  Over the last couple of years I have been increasingly frustrated by the appearance of face tagging on services like Facebook, and the recent <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/#faces">addition of face recognition to iPhoto</a> has brought this frustration to the surface once again.Â  I don&rsquo;t even want to do something as complex as face recognition - I just want to find faces in an image.</p>

<p>Googling for things like &ldquo;open source face detector&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t come up with much.Â  The landscape seems to be comprised of mostly expensive for-pay libraries written for Windows, abandoned research projects, and lots of research papers full of equations &ndash; but no code that I could get to run.</p>

<p>To make a long post short, it turns out that Intel&rsquo;s <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/">OpenCV</a> computer vision library comes with a <a href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/FaceDetection">face detector</a> example that should work out of the box.Â  Better yet, there are now some decent <a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~gb/wp/blog/2007/02/04/python-opencv-wrapper-using-ctypes/">Python bindings</a> for OpenCV that come pre-packaged with OpenCV for Ubuntu and Debian.Â  You can install them with:
<code>
$ sudo apt-get install python-opencv
</code></p>

<p>Now, it seems that most OpenCV <a href="http://blog.jozilla.net/2008/06/27/fun-with-python-opencv-and-face-detection/">face detector examples</a> are meant to be run &ldquo;live&rdquo;, usually taking the image from a webcam and highlighting faces with a red box in real-time.Â  However, I have a large database of static images that I want to consider individually, and I simply want to save the face coordinates for later use, rather than altering the picture.</p>

<p>So, with a bit more Googling, I found a Python script that I could chop up and use for this purpose, and here is what I came up with:</p>

<script src="//gist.github.com/67044.js"></script>

<p>An example run of the script looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ python face_detect.py marty_mcguire.jpg
[(50,36) -&gt; (115,101)]
</code></pre>

<p>You can overlay that rectangle on an output image with ImageMagick&rsquo;s &ldquo;convert&rdquo;:</p>

<pre><code>$ convert marty_mcguire.jpg -stroke red -fill none -draw &quot;rectangle 50,36 115,101&quot; output.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>And the output might look something like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.creatingwithcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/output.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-18" title="My face: detected!" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.creatingwithcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/output.jpg" alt="My face, it has been detected." width="180" height="240" /></a></p>

<p>Pretty fun stuff!</p>
