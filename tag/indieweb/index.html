<p>Baltimore's second <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/09/20/125531/">Homebrew Website Club of October</a> met at the <a href="https://digitialharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on October 16th.</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>
  jonathanprozzi.net — Worked today on a post recapping our last HWC meeting, focusing on ideas to get more people involved. For work at DHF, still learning lots of NextJS and ExpressJS. Getting back into writing content!
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  derekfields.is — Been a while! Last week in Minnesota for some networking. Met some cool people and talked to some companies, including <a href="https://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a>, which was part of <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/">Open Baltimore</a>. Also got back into bullet journaling after being away for a while. Working on legal and client-finding stuff for his freelance work.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  pulianas.com — Also been awhile since he's been to an HWC! Moved all his sites to HTTPS. His podcast (overanalyzed.fm) is now on iTunes, so he added that link to the site. Also tried to track down an official Overcast button but hasn't found it yet. Recently in San Jose for API World. Very little talk about building APIs and more about pitching specific products/services. Did learn a bit about microservices and case-studies of moving to them. Did some general maintenance on his WP site, and has been working on his own plugin for podcasting on WP.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  martymcgui.re — Been heavily porting his site from Jekyll to Hugo. Has had some fun porting things that he did as Ruby plugins for Jekyll into crazy Go template logic, like generating permashortlinks in <a href="http://tantek.pbworks.com/w/page/19402946/NewBase60">NewBase60</a>. Also had some fun setting up a new CSS Grid display for photos in posts with lots of them (<a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/10/06/144700/">example</a> which apparently only works in Firefox). Also, after some struggling with his image proxy setup (because Hugo templating doesn't support HMAC signatures) is trying out <a href="https://cloudinary.com/">Cloudinary's</a> free tier for his image-resizing needs.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Podcasting on WordPress is... a pain. Apple Podcasts refused to accept their feed due to http vs https issues and that was hard to track down.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.wooji-juice.com/products/ferrite/">Ferrite</a> for audio editing on the iPad. Alec edits his podcasts there now. Some hiccups with the noise-cancelling and auto-levelling features being too-aggressive.</li>
  <li>Recording setups. <a href="https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti-nano/">Blue's new Yeti Nano</a> looks cool.</li>
  <li>
    FF and Chrome starting to support the new dialog element. Maybe cool, maybe terrible?
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-10-03-homebrew-website-club">first Homebrew Website Club of October</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on October 3rd.</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> — No updates since last time for his personal site. Was burned out after a lot of frustration with Gatsby + WordPress headless. Got to the point of feeling helpless and like he couldn't figure out how to progress. Started porting to <a href="https://zeit.co/blog/next">Next.js</a> and has some renewed energy because he is making progress and enjoying it.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Went to <a href="https://indieweb.org/2018/NYC">IndieWebCamp NYC</a>! Didn't do anything new for his site, but did manage to write a <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/10/02/155150/">post full of project ideas</a> that he came away with. Really interested in using free services like <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> (for server-side processing), <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> (static file hosting), and <a href="https://cloudinary.com/">Cloudinary</a> (make thumbnail images from those giant originals) to make IndieWeb building blocks that people without coding experience could combine to make their own sites. Currently thinking of building a <a href="https://indieweb.org/media_endpoint">Micropub Media Endpoint</a> that handles dynamic image resizing to see how this approach works.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ideas from the IndieWebCamp NYC Organizer's meeting about "messaging" for Homebrew Website Clubs. The name is often confusing or off-putting for newcomers, and oddly self-selecting for those that "get it". Thinking about rebranding to "Indie Web Meetup" – evokes "independent web" and a meetup is more inviting than a "club" which might have membership requirements.</li>
  <li>Talked a lot about how many folks who come to HWC are WordPress users and how we might do better by them if we made it more clear that we are here to help them power up their WordPress sites.</li>
  <li>Or even go a step further and simply offer to get people started with or improve their existing personal site. If we can get people to the meetups, no matter the skill level, we can get them started: sign-up for micro.blog to get going right away, put a simple static HTML page up on glitch or GitHub, dive into WordPress, etc.</li>
  <li>First steps may be to think of it more like an open hours help desk. The "price" of getting help can be to write up all the steps followed, as a way of documenting steps for future folks who might need it. The goal would be to have folks come and actually leave with something accomplished.</li>
  <li>
    Also talked about difficulties with estimating the limitations of tools before you invest a bunch of time in learning to use it and understand it deeply. Jonathan's experience with Gatsby was a prime example – ultimately he needed it to do something it didn't support well, but it took a lot of frustration to find out that the issue was with the tool being a bad fit for the problem.
    <br />
  </li>

  <h1 class="post-title p-name"><a href="/2018/10/02/quick-thoughts-on-project-ideas-from-indiewebcamp-nyc-2018/">Quick thoughts on project ideas from IndieWebCamp NYC 2018</a></h1>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  
  
    
    <div class="post e-content">
<p>
  I attended <a href="https://indieweb.org/2018/NYC">IndieWebCamp NYC 2018</a> and it was a blast! Check the <a href="https://indieweb.org/2018/NYC#Schedule">schedule</a> for links to notes and videos from the awesome keynotes, discussion sessions, and build-day demos. I am so grateful to all the other <a href="https://indieweb.org/2018/NYC#Organizers">organizers</a>, to all the new and familiar faces that came out, to those that joined us remotely, to <a href="https://www.pace.edu/seidenberg/">Pace University's Seidenberg School</a> for hosting us, and of course to the <a href="https://indieweb.org/2018/NYC#Sponsors">sponsors</a> that made it all possible.
  <br />
</p>
<p>I have a lot of thoughts about all the discussions and projects that were talked about, I'm sure. But for now, I'd like to capture some of the TODOs and project ideas that I came away with after the event, and the post-event discussions over food and drink.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A <a href="https://indieweb.org/media_endpoint">Micropub Media Endpoint</a> built on <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> for storage and <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> for handling uploads and metadata. It would allow folks to store 1GB of media files like photos, audio, and video for their websites, for free. It would be usable with all kinds of <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients">posting tools</a>, no matter what <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Servers">backend</a> you use for your site.
    <ul>
      <li>(Hilarious?) bonus: that content would be available <a href="https://blog.neocities.org/blog/2015/09/08/its-time-for-the-distributed-web.html">peer-to-peer over IPFS</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Improve the <a href="https://indieweb.org/indiewebring">IndieWeb Web Ring</a> (<a href="https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/">🕸💍.ws</a>) to automatically check whether members' sites link back using <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">Webmention</a>. (I managed to make a <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/09/29/114553/">small but often-asked-for update</a> to the site during IWC)</li>
  <li>
    Improve how my website handles all <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/09/29/160439/">these</a> <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/09/29/161113/">check-in</a> <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/09/29/182249/">posts</a> which are made when someone else checks me in on <a href="https://www.swarmapp.com/">Swarm</a>. I would like to show who checked me in, at least, if not some of their photos, or maybe even an embedded version of the post from their site.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Keep doing the <a href="https://martymcgui.re/podcasts/indieweb/">This Week in the IndieWeb podcast</a>! I had been feeling some burnout about this and falling behind. It was so great to talk with folks who listen to it and rely on it to keep up to date with the goings-on in the community!</li>
  <li>Offer a hand with <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">aaronpk's</a> new <a href="https://monstr.space/">social monster catching game</a>, built on IndieWeb building blocks.</li>
  <li>Offer a hand with <a href="http://jgregorymcverry.com/">jgmac1106's</a> <a href="http://jgregorymcverry.com/my-goals-for-indiewebcamp-nyc-openbadges-endorsement-at-the-dns-level/">idea</a> to issue educational course achievements (<a href="http://jgregorymcverry.com/webmention-badges-discussion-across-networks-after-indiewebcamp-nyc-session/">badges</a>) via IndieWeb building blocks.</li>
  <li>Work on closing down <a href="https://camura.com/">Camura</a>, a photo-sharing social network I helped build during the awkward age after the first "camera phones" and before Facebook introduced "Mobile Uploads". It has over 100k photos and 50k comments from around 400 folks. I'd like to let it down gently, make sure people have access to those photos, and maybe even preserve some of the best moments of human connection in a public place.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  More generally: I think there's a <i>really cool</i> future where <a href="https://indieweb.org/Category:building-blocks">IndieWeb building blocks</a> are available on free services like Glitch and Neocities. New folks should be able to register a domain and plug them together in an afternoon, with no coding, and get a website that supports posting all kinds of content and social interactions. All for the cost of a domain! And all with the ability to download their content and take it with them if these services change or they outgrow them. I <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/03/12/130455/">already built some of this</a> as a goof. The big challenges are simplifying the UX and documenting all of the steps to show folks what they will get and how to get it.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other fun / ridiculous ideas discussed over the weekend:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Support Facebook-style colored-background posts <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/09/30/113226/">like aaronpk did at IWC</a>. I love the simplicity of adding an RGB color as a hashtag.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    "This American Bachelor" (working title only) - a dating site as a podcast. Each episode (or season??) is an NPR-style deep dive into the life and longings of a single person looking for love. Alternate title: "Single". The cocktail-driven discussion that produced this idea was a joy.
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I am sure there are fun ideas that were discussed that I am leaving out. If you can think of any, let me know!

<p>Are you a member of the <a href="https://🕸💍.ws">🕸💍</a> IndieWeb Webring? Today I made an update!</p>

<p>All members of the webring get a unique emoji ID when they first sign in. Previously, those emoji might have included the flag of a country or state, and not everyone wants to be associated with a random country or state!</p>

<p>From now on, new emoji IDs will not include country flags.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a member of the webring already, and would like a new emoji ID, feel free to drop me a line in the <a href="https://chat.indieweb.org/">#indieweb chat</a> (I&rsquo;m <code>schmarty</code> there). I&rsquo;ll reset your account and you&rsquo;ll get a new emoji ID. You&rsquo;ll also have to update the webring links code on your page to make sure they point to your new ID!</p>

    <div class="post e-content">
<p>Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-09-18-homebrew-website-club">first Homebrew Website Club of September</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on September 18th.</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> — Has been travelling and getting married and had lots of time to think about things! Not to work on them, though. Catching back up on things like Gatsby pages for Digital Harbor Foundation. Feeling some maintenance pains now with Gatsby's GraphQL queries pulling HUGE amounts of data from a WordPress backend – about a 5 minute process for each site build. Upgrading to Gatsby 2 would also require a bunch of changes that he isn't wanting to do. Also, something in the Gatsby build process just broke, without him making any code changes. Wishing now he had built the site in <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>, which uses REST over GraphQL. For his personal site, he is thinking about how much effort he wants to put into things. He typically uses his personal site as a way to learn new technology, but is now wary of force-fitting things that aren't a good fit. Maybe tweaking his current WordPress site would be a better use of time than rewriting the site. Particularly since he hasn't posted since July.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://rhearamakrishnan.com/">rhearamakrishnan.com</a> — Not much new on her personal site, since it's working well for her purposes. Posted some new stuff she made over the summer, including a micro chap-book called <a href="https://ghostcitypress.com/2018-summer-microchap-series/it-makes-more-noise-than-i-thought-it-would">It Makes More Noise Than I Thought It Would</a>. Been working on other summer projects, like writing poems on postcards for people. Photographing and typing those up to make a mini-collection. Wants to build something on <a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine</a>, if she can include a form so people can write letters back to her. She's gonna write out the adventure as she wants it and then think about what kind of interactivity she'd like from readers. Thinking about designing a mini-course for DHF around Twine for students to build stories around it.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Hasn't really made much progress on any personal or IndieWeb projects since the last HWC meeting. Had a couple of out of town trips and projects that were good and fulfilling experiences, like going to <a href="https://www.improvutopia.com/iu-east/">Camp Improv Utopia East</a>. Those experiences highlighted that maybe he is feeling burned out about some IndieWeb things! For example, he has been letting the <a href="https://martymcgui.re/podcasts/indieweb/">This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition</a> slip more and more each week and finding it hard to focus. He's trying to figure out what to do for the upcoming IndieWebCamp NYC, which he is excited about, but feeling a bit overwhelmed by project ideas, things he should be doing to help organize, etc.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>https://twinery.org/ is great for creating interactive stuff - and it seems like the output is plain HTML? So it should be possible to add a form from some service like <a href="https://formspree.io/">Formspree</a> or <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> to an exported project, if the tool doesn't offer exactly that kind of thing.</li>
  <li>Dealing with burnout and feeling stuck on things. Sometimes it helps to get energized by doing something else. Sometimes doing those other things really highlights that you have energy, just not for those things you're burned out on!</li>
  <li>Principle of Least Power is another big thing, here. Jonathan and Marty have both been struggling with projects where the tooling or the plumbing may be taking all the energy available.</li>
  <li>Semantic HTML and CSS can do so much, now. We looked at this <a href="http://www.mattzeunert.com/2017/10/30/javascript-free-todo-app.html">CSS-only TODO MVC proof of concept</a>. Talked about HTML definition lists, summary/details tags, figure/figcaption, and more.</li>
  <li>
    Talked about the <a href="https://sonniesedge.co.uk/talks/dear-developer">pyramid of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and the inverted pyramid of overbuilt JS-dependent frameworks</a>.
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>

  Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-08-22-homebrew-website-club">second Homebrew Website Club of August</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on August 22nd! 
  <br />
</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>
  shawngrimes.me — Shawn has been working on <a href="http://teamruby.dog/">teamruby.dog</a>. Specifically, collecting content. It's a new WordPress site. Thought about Squarespace because of ease of maintenance but can't justify the pricing. Also trying to find a way to post some 360 panorama photos from a recent road trip through 19 states.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  martymcgui.re — Finally started the grueling work of translating his site's data from Jekyll into Hugo. It involved writing lots of little scripts to do things like maintain redirects for old date-based URL slugs, RSS for podcast feeds, and other plumbing. Next up is to port his existing templates over, which should be a big process. Also started a tribute site to his cat Nitro at nitro.rocks. Hoping to make it an IndieWeb-project by getting folks to contribute fun cat memories by posting to their own site and syndicating to nitro.rocks.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Ways to showcase 360 photos. Ricoh apps can (could?) post interactive panoramas to Facebook/Twitter. Marty posted some interactive panoramas on his site back in 2016 (<a href="https://martymcgui.re/2016/08/28/114014/">example</a>), but isn't super happy with the experience.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>RSS (and Indie) readers</li>
  <li>Webmentions and notifications</li>
  <li>
    Badging (and politics)
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been really enjoying the focus on personal websites that <a href="http://vihart.com/">Vi Hart</a> and <a href="http://www.blinkpopshift.com/">M Eifler aka blinkpopshift</a> have been putting into their recent Patrons-only VIM LIVE streams.</p>

<p>In addition to some great discussion about subscribing to RSS feeds of personal sites, I have really enjoyed the homework-slash-games like &ldquo;post something on your website&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://vihart.com/my-not-tweets-7-21-2018/">collect what you might have tweeted into a blog</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot that the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> can learn from discussions like these as folks from different backgrounds are (re-)discovering what the web can be.</p>

<p>You can find previous and future VIM LIVE streams by supporting <a href="https://www.patreon.com/BlinkPopShift/posts">blinkpopshift</a> or <a href="patreon.com/vihart">Vi Hart</a> on Patreon.</p>

  Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-07-25-homebrew-website-club">second Homebrew Website Club of July</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on July 25th!
  <br />
</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://derekfields.is/">derekfields.is</a> — Derek wanted a couple new rules for sharing time, today. First, find and share a site with some cool tech that you like. Second, talk about why you're into web development. He showed off a demo of using the browser Gamepad API w/ a Playstation dual-shock 3 controller. It showed button state changes, including analog states for buttons and joysticks. Been thinking about lots of ideas lately but missing some focus. Looking at productivity hacks to focus more. Notices when he's not focusing, now trying prompts to figure out why he's distracted and get back on task. Derek is into web development because it changes rapidly and requires focus to keep learning. Been working on his VueJS class and it's been going well until today. His accountability buddy is on a trip.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> — Been working on work stuff. Built a single-page app w/ Gatsby for deploys of some Digital Harbor Foundation content for use in remote schools with intermittent internet connections. Pulls course data from the central DHF WordPress and deploys it as a package on Netlify. Ran into his first deploy issues with Netlify due to case-sensitive filesystems (which he doesn't experience on his Mac dev machine). Been really inspired by the <a href="https://sustywp.com/">Susty WordPress theme</a> which can deliver WordPress pages in ~6KB, compared with most themes, which are very bloated. Jonathan is into the web because of the problem-solving aspects of it, but also because it allows creative expression and productivity.</p>
<p><a href="https://zach.oglesby.co/">zach.oglesby.co</a> — New! Welcome, Zach! Recently switched his Known-powered site to <a href="https://cleverdevil.io/">Jonathan LaCour's</a> overview page (w/ location info and other nice things), but it doesn't have a representative h-card, yet, so working on that. Also working on making his read posts more compatible with <a href="https://indiebookclub.biz/">IndieBookClub</a>. In terms of "Cool Tech", just had occasion to use Bootstrap for the first time, which was interesting. Zach is into web development because there are so many ways to do things on the web, you can play and tinker with different things you might not have otherwise.</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://pulianas.com/">pulianas.com</a> — New! Welcome, Alec! Has had this website for a while, originally as a portfolio, now as a WordPress site that powers his Micro.blog. Been working on a new site for a podcast, <a href="http://overanalyzed.fm/">Overanalyzed</a>, also WordPress. In terms of "Cool Tech" - likes <a href="https://eddiehinkle.com/">Eddie Hinkle's website</a>. Also, webrings "seem pretty cool". Isn't a web developer professionally, but likes how it makes publishing easy. Really also likes the concept of owning your own content, bringing his stuff in from Twitter. Sees his online identities as layers: website is most personal, Twitter next, and Facebook is sanitized.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Been working on the <a href="http://baltimoreimprovfestival.org/">Baltimore Improv Festival</a> website, a static site generator called <a href="https://github.com/ruhoh/ruhoh.rb">Ruhoh</a> that doesn't really "exist" as a project anymore, though the code and gems are still out there. Needs to spend time on the webrings site. In terms of "Cool Tech", likes this recent <a href="https://youtu.be/vs34f9FiHps">"Even More CSS Secrets" talk</a> from <a href="https://lea.verou.me/">Lea Verou</a>. Marty is into web development because it is an amazing way to share content that anyone can access from anywhere in the world! "Can it be done on the web?" is an interesting, if sometimes difficult, lens to see the world through.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.unicornriot.ninja/2018/hope-conference-criticized-for-allowing-far-right-harassment/">Code-of-Conduct issues with the recent Hackers On Planet Earth conference</a> that Marty attended last weekend.</li>
  <li>Deploying things on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>! Marty tried his first Netlify site during quiet writing hour, as a potential host for the <a href="http://baltimoreimprovfestival.org/">Baltimore Improv Festival</a> website, which is currently on an old shared host.</li>
  <li>Tools for writing VueJS (and using Visual Studio Code for it). Like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vue+snippets+for+vscode&amp;atb=v51-3_a&amp;ia=software">Vue Snippets for VS Code</a>, linting tools, and <a href="https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/">Sarah Drasner</a>'s CSS tricks articles about VueJS.</li>
  <li><a href="https://brutalist-web.design/">brutalist-web.design</a> and the principle of least power when building things.</li>
  <li>Talked about how mobile designs can be better than "full" desktop site designs. E.g. <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> vs. <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/home">mobile Twitter</a>. But also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> vs. <a href="https://m.facebook.com/">mobile Facebook</a> vs. <a href="https://mbasic.facebook.com/">"basic" mobile Facebook</a>, the last of which has no Javascript!</li>
  <li>Getting around town. E.g. the new Bird scooters that are here in Baltimore.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="post e-content">
Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-07-11-homebrew-website-club">first Homebrew Website Club of July</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on July 11th! 
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> — Been building static HTML/CSS layouts for fun! <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/learning/fun-with-html-css-layouts-part-one-layouts-1-3/">Some</a> <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/learning/fun-with-html-css-layouts-part-two/">examples</a>. Also started practicing turning those designs into layouts in <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a>. Had a usability testing call w/ the folks from <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a> that turned into a great discussion about how to better build community starters.</p>
<a href="http://www.dariusmccoy.com/">dariusmccoy.com</a> — Was having some issues w/ his site, which is hosted on AWS. He is thinking about wiping his instance and starting a new one, since he has lost track of some of his passwords. In a tricky spot because AWS doesn't offer any tech support for free tier users. Talked about switching to Digital Ocean or something simpler but will have to balance his budgets to justify the costs.
<p><a href="http://derekfields.is/">derekfields.is</a> — Been taking a Udemy course on VueJS. Before that has been working on a schedule for developing his website. Has a friend doing the same and they mutually keep each other on track to spend a certain amount of time on developing their skills and sites. It's kind of working!</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Brought a bunch of stickers and other fun things home from IndieWeb Summit! Had a great time seeing folks he met last year and meeting new folks. Lots of great discussion sessions, hacking projects, wild ideas, and more. He really needs to write it up on his site! His hack day project also desperately needs to be written up – it's an IndieWeb-style web ring, available at <a>🕸💍.ws</a> ! This week he added support for <a href="https://indielogin.com/">indielogin.com</a>, which lets people sign in using their own websites by <a href="https://indieweb.org/RelMeAuth">setting up only a couple of links</a>.
  <br />
</p>
Other discussion:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/2018">IndieWeb Summit</a>! Marty went and loved it. Next year would love to bring more folks from HWC Baltimore, and travel assistance is available. We'll work on it.</li>
  <li>
    Marty met <a href="http://ewy.me/">Jared Ewy</a> of <a href="https://name.com/">name.com</a> at the Summit and talked about all the cool work DHF does teaching youth to build websites, the upcoming Web Shop, hosting HWC and IWC Baltimore, etc. Jared gave him a bunch of codes for free domains and some hosting discounts to benefit that work, so we discussed lots of ideas!
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Some possibilities: give Web Shop youth employees incentive to work on their own projects, outside of paid jobs, to learn more about building their own sites. Host a special Homebrew Website Club that's a 2-hour jam for new folks who don't have a domain yet to get set up with a website. Host a longer "Build Your Website Day" (maybe in coordination with a <a href="https://twitter.com/sdepolo/status/1011739362122334208">multi-city Drag Queen Build-a-Website Day</a>?)</li>
  <li>What would an IndieWeb "starter pack" look like for a quick "you have a domain but no money" way to get started? GitHub looks good for skill building for folks that want to get into web development someday because it's mostly managed by hand. Netlify looks pretty good for this because they offer hosting, flexible static site generation, SSL for HTTPS, and the NetlifyCMS. They also support some features like building your own webhooks on JavaScript, which could eventually be used to handle common IndieWeb building block endpoints (IndieAuth, Micropub, Webmention, ...) Because they run all the stuff for a given site from a git repository, it's possible to take a site from Netlify and set it up elsewhere if their offerings change.</li>
  <li>"Packages" for a getting started workshop. E.g. "what will you get at the end + what will you need to learn along the way." Static HTML/CSS on GitHub could get a portfolio site done. For $5/mo a <a href="http://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> site can be hosted on a custom domain and requires no Git/GitHub wrangling. <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> hosting is also $5/mo and brings a ton of features, interactivity, and community.</li>
  <li>Talked about VueJS passing React in terms of number of stars on GitHub, and speculating why that is. For example, VueJS can be a lot easier to dip your toes in and get started without a complicated build toolchain.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="post e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://2018.indieweb.org/">2018 IndieWeb Summit</a> is now less than a week away, and I'd like to personally invite you, (yes, you!) to join us there.</p>
<p>IWS kicks off with a pre-party on Monday evening at the <a href="http://www.pinestreetpdx.com/">Pine Street Market</a> where you can enjoy some great handmade food and drinks. More importantly, you can meet and befriend some of the most earnest and clever folks I know when it comes to having fun being yourself on the web. You're likely to share stories about how <a href="https://indieweb.org/why#Avoiding_problems">awful silos like Facebook and Twitter have become</a>, get inspired to build things you didn't even know you wanted to put on your website, and hatch schemes for what you'd love to learn, discuss, and build over the next two days.</p>
<p>Tuesday is a day of discussions and, while there will be some <a href="https://indieweb.org/2018/Schedule#Tuesday">extremely great keynote talks</a> and a chance to show off your favorite feature on your own site, most of the day is reserved for discussions chosen by the folks who attend. I've seen sessions range from the extremely technical (build a Micropub server in 40 minutes) to the extremely personal (what is the meaning of identity on the web?). If you've got burning questions, you can volunteer to lead a session on a topic even (especially?) if you're not an expert. If you're not sure sit in on whatever feels interesting to you! There is no pressure to be clever.</p>
<p>Wednesday is all about creating. Take something you learned from Tuesday, or just something you've been meaning to do, and build it! There will be some optional HowTo sessions for some of the technical IndieWeb building blocks, and lots of knowledgable folks who would love to answer questions and even collaborate on projects. At the end of the day, you can show off what you've got. Or not! It's your website, no pressure.</p>
<p>As the producer of a <a href="https://martymcgui.re/podcasts/indieweb/">weekly informational podcast about the IndieWeb</a>, I would love to chat with anyone who is willing! I'll be conducting one-minute interviews on what inspired folks to get involved in the IndieWeb and what they're working on for their personal website. If you want to be interviewed, but we don't find time during the Summit, I'll be around Portland on Thursday, and on Friday I'll be around the <a href="https://ti.to/stumptown-syndicate/open-source-bridge-10-year-celebration">Open Source Bridge un-conference</a>.</p>
<p>IndieWeb Summit was one of the most inspiring events for me when I attended my first one in 2017. In the year since I have been inspired to add tons of new things to my website and built out some new IndieWeb-related tools, which <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Martymcgui.re">I've (sort of) kept track of</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://indieweb.org/Baltimore">Homebrew Website Club Baltimore</a> celebrated our <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/09/20/204109/">1-year anniversary</a>, and hosted <a href="https://2018.indieweb.org/baltimore">Baltimore's first IndieWebCamp</a>!</p>
<p>So, no matter where you are in terms of technical skills, what your website currently looks like or does, or whether it even exists yet, I encourage you to join us at IndieWeb Summit!</p>

<p>
  Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-06-13-homebrew-website-club">first Homebrew Website Club of June</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on June 13th!
  <br />
</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://derekfields.is/">derekfields.is</a> — Thinking about ESP8266 + WebAR to make, e.g. a painting with AR overlays in mobile browsers. Working on CSS Grid stuff for his site, now. Trying to be consistent.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> — Mainly been working on stuff for <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">DHF</a>, but it overlaps w/ personal projects. Working on a "headless WordPress" setup as a data source for a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> or <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next</a> static site that can be taken to schools w/ super slow internet. Been learning how to use Gatsby – the GraphQL queries for WordPress have been tricky. Got it working on his own site first, then managed to get a handle on how to pull lessons for specific courses from the set of all courses. Now digging into more GraphQL (like debugging w/ <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a>) and issues like differences in how WordPress handles whitespace (processing newlines into paragraph and break tags) vs stuffing the content into a React component (no special whitespace processing by default). For personal stuff, feels like Gatsby + headless WP is too heavy. Interested in an IndieWeb-starter version of the Gatsby starter site, which doesn't even have semantic HTML at the moment. Also looking into WordPress + Next... next, because it seems simpler.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.dariusmccoy.com/">dariusmccoy.com</a> — Went to <a href="https://www.nomcon.org/">NOMCON</a> and helped build the <a href="https://www.wethebuilders.com/projects/8">We the Rosies sculpture</a>. Will be working on a new project for DHF for managing 3D Print Shop.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Installed <a href="https://grant.codes/">grant.codes</a>' <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postrchild/ecifafdialoohbgngelfbjplgbhiklpm">PostrChild plugin for Chrome</a>. It shows Edit Post buttons on his posts and makes the content there editable via Micropub and it is very neat! Also showed off his <a href="https://indiebookclub.biz/">indiebookclub.biz</a> <a href="https://indiebookclub.biz/users/martymcgui.re">profile</a>. Added support for read posts to his site to support it and is now converting old read posts (which were just notes of the form "📕 Finished Reading: ...") into this new form. Has ideas for additions to indiebookclub like URLs for books and authors, tags, text content, and backfeeding entries from his site to complete his profile. Will be dropping in his Goodreads data next.</p>
<p><a href="https://bouhmad.com/">bouhmad.com</a> — Been implementing a speedtest-like app on a new site for Baltimore City to gather data by census block and compare. Part of his new(ish) project to establish a mesh network for the city!</p>
<p>
  Other discussion:

</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://indieweb.org/2018">IndieWeb Summit</a>! I think next HWC Baltimore may be happening during IWS demo time. Maybe it'll be streaming here!
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://jgregorymcverry.com/">Greg McVerry's</a> work on IndieWeb and WordPress and education. His most recent post on <a href="https://jgregorymcverry.com/can-we-build-a-static-site-generator-for-indieweb/">building a course management system in IndieWeb-style</a> feels very much in line with what Jonathan has been working on.</li>
  <li>"Headless" Micropub CMS - what would these look like? Jonathan is interested in <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page">Microformats2</a> as the storage format for posts, courses, and other data, and <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub">Micropub</a> seems like the way that MF2 data gets shipped around for creating/editing posts. But most Micropub clients are built for creating (and rarely editing) very specific kinds of posts.</li>
  <li>Comparison to Netlify CMS - which is built around Git and flat files. Netlify can get a list of all your posts by listing files in Git. A Micropub-based CMS would need to query a list of all posts, with filters like post type, tags, ...</li>
  <li>GraphQL queries over MF2 properties??</li>
  <li>Facebook's API changes have <a href="https://snarfed.org/2018-06-07_turning-off-facebook-for-bridgy">caused Bridgy to stop working</a> for backfeeding reactions and comments, and Publish will stop working in August. Jonathan thought his site configuration was broken as he wasn't getting backfed comments and likes anymore. Basically: Facebook has shut out the IndieWeb. This feels like a huge problem (for the IndieWeb)! How are people working around it? Are they? This may help usher IndieWeb folks out the door for Facebook, but it almost completely stops people who want to be in that in-between space.</li>

    <div class="post e-content">
<p>It's been a while! Again! We cancelled our previous meetup due to weather.</p>
<p>Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-05-29-homebrew-website-club">second Homebrew Website Club of May</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on May 29th!</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dariusmccoy.com/">dariusmccoy.com</a> – Playing with Squarespace because he expects to have youth using it for the upcoming Web Shop launch at DHF. In ~3 weeks! He's trying to clone the existing <a href="http://printshop.digitalharbor.org/">DHF 3D Print Shop website</a> in it, but finding it a bit restricting. Playing w/ some CodePens for nice animations/transitions but having trouble getting those into the Squarespace editing tools. Wants to use them for within-page links.</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://derekfields.is/">derekfields.is</a> – Been struggling w/ goals on personal website stuff. Has been applying for webdev jobs, though! Waiting to hear back. Has been working on his startup idea - an LED backpack for biking. It's controlled by a microcontroller and he wants it to serve a webpage over WiFi so you can control it from your phone without installing anything.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – Spent time tonight writing a post because he hasn't in a long time. The post includes shaming himself for not writing posts. Writing up his experiences from a recent conference where DHF was receiving an award. Building apps with GatsbyJS which are PWAs that work offline, so the content he writes for DHF can work for people who have viewed them even if the internet goes down.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – "Launched" his GIPHY-backed GIF posting app <a href="http://kapowski.schmarty.net/">Kapowski</a>. After feedback from last time, made it work without requiring logins (making it usable by people who aren't all wired up with IndieAuth on their sites). Thinking about ways to progressively enhance Kapowski, such as saving favorites that can be viewed offline, offline sending with posts going out when the internet comes back, etc. Been going all in on micropub for his personal notes that exist on a private site. Used <a href="https://github.com/Inklings-io/selfauth">selfauth</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Zegnat/php-mintoken">mintoken</a>, <a href="https://github.com/skpy/micropub">skippy's micropub server</a>, <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/spano">spano for media</a>, and built a new <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html">nginx auth_request</a> service that uses IndieAuth and an access control list to allow only him to view the private posts. Hoping to clean that up and release it someday soon. Also started first steps for another long-term micropub-related project to assist sites that support micropub for creating and editing posts but don't want to build their own infrastructure for syndication. It's called <a href="https://glitch.com/~fanatical-wound">"POSSE Party"</a>, and currently it's a <a href="https://indieweb.org/manual_until_it_hurts">manual-til-it-hurts</a> Micropub editor that lets you manage mp-syndicate-to and syndication properties for posts. Someday he hopes to make something that can use bridgy or silo.pub to automate syndication for people whose sites don't do that.</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    LED mounting strategies for backpacks. Big diffusers make for good looking LEDs but surface mount parts make things easier to mount.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Jonathan's experiences at the conference. His takeaways from talks about making human-centered technology. E.g. "context is everything, a perfectly engineered span is useless, but the Brooklyn bridge connects people". He's thinking a lot about common themes around technology that works *for* humans. For example, so many people don't have internet all the time!</li>

  <blockquote class="p-summary"><p>&ldquo;It is common to refer to universally popular social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest as “walled gardens.” But they are not gardens; they are walled industrial sites, within which users, for no financial compensation, produce data which the owners of the factories sift and then sell. Some of these factories (Twitter, Tumblr, and more recently Instagram) have transparent walls, by which I mean that you need an account to post anything but can view what has been posted on the open Web; others (Facebook, Snapchat) keep their walls mostly or wholly opaque. But they all exercise the same disciplinary control over those who create or share content on their domain.&rdquo;</p>

    <div class="post e-content">
<p>It's been a while!</p>
<p>
  Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-05-01-homebrew-website-club">first Homebrew Website Club of May</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on May 1st!
</p>
<p>In celebration of 5/01 aka HTTP 501 Not Implemented, we'll talk about things we wish that our websites did, but that they don't yet do.</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – Been working on lots of other projects. Did two work projects with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org">GatsbyJS</a>. One is deployed but not public. Learned a lot about GraphQL. Working on a handbook for youth training and trying to get a <a href="https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms">netlify CMS</a> hooked up to it. Also did a small <a href="https://vuejs.org/">VueJS</a> project to learn a bit more about it. Wants to use the WordPress API with some of these technologies on his site. 501 desire: going headless for his WordPress site because he is obsessed with PageSpeed.</p>
<p><a href="http://maryreisenwitz.com/">maryreisenwitz.com</a> – Been working on sites and content for work. Trying to capture FAQs about working at DHF in preparation for a couple of dozen new youth to start working here. Finds that good explanations uncover the need for more good explanations and lots of branching docs, as different youth employees will have different responsibilities. Excited about having this resource be a website. Wants to include a youth "face book" of names and faces so the new folks can recognize one another and existing staff. 501 desire: wants a web store on her main site, because Etsy is becoming frustrating.  </p>
<p><a href="https://bouhmad.com/">bouhmad.com</a> – Set up SSL via <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">LetsEncrypt</a> and loves it, the easiest SSL setup he has ever done. Started a blog post about intrusion detection, kept adding to it, and pushed it out last week. Working on a piece about a bug bounty he recently collected, working with the company in question. 501 desire: a mailing list signup and a Hugo-driven RSS feed to a Mailchimp mailing list.</p>
<p><a href="https://grant.codes/">grant.codes</a> – Visiting as he drives across the US! Restructuring his site's data on the backend. Was using something like mf2 data, but now moving to pure mf2. Broke a bunch of features doing that, so going through to fix those now. 501 desire: homepage mentions! He accepts but doesn't store or display them.</p>
<p><a href="https://eddiehinkle.com/">eddiehinkle.com</a> – Working on leaving Facebook! Has made a sign-up form for friends/family to sign up for monthly (for now) newsletter. Has a complex (too complex?) tagging for tech, personal, family to generate three RSS feeds. These can be subscribed to in any combination (so 9 possible feeds), and the emails will combine all posts in the desired feeds. The feeds themselves reuse markup that he wrote to make posts look good on micro.blog. Just posted monthly review for March and hopes to keep doing summaries. Uses the "last month" view on his site for the raw data. 501 desire: automated webmentions! His site is Jekyll-based, so that's a can of worms. Loves using Indigenous for the quick responses from the indie reader, but then has to go back to his site and manually send webmentions.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – Traveled recently and checked in everywhere using Swarm, which feeds back to his site (sorry anyone following feeds)! Really enjoyed it, but slightly regrets giving Swarm all that data. Thinks an app could use the Swarm venue API to do Micropub and skip creating the checkins on the server. 501 desire: unlisted posts! Really wants to make photo gallery posts where each photo has a permalink but only the gallery shows up in feeds. Eventually private posts, too.</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Grant's automated year-in-review feature. Cities visited, hours of TV, distance traveled (tracks GPS constantly).
  </li>
  <li>Ways to do hidden posts. Categories. Unlisted or private as a property.</li>
  <li>Email lists vs "followers" on social media and the feeling of reach.</li>
  <li>Facebook's reaction when you start mass deleting friends. Mary once deleted close to 700 people and found that the interface started rearranging itself, putting people back in the list where it's easy to mis-click and re-add them as a friend.</li>
  <li>Deleting your posts from Facebook. Does it affect the algorithm? What threats does it eliminate?</li>
  <li>Family signing up for email blasts: would they reply? What if those replies went to an address that turned them into a comment on your site? If their email address is in your nickname cache, you can show their name and photo and url.</li>
</ul>

  Thanks to everybody who came out! We hope to see you all again at our next meeting on <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-05-15-homebrew-website-club">May 15th</a>!

  Baltimore's <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/04/02/161711/">first Homebrew Website Club of April</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on April 10th
  <br />
</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – Demoed an as-yet-unnamed (maybe: kapowski) "GIF Reaction" Micropub client. It's <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/garrulous-smile">currently available on Glitch</a>. It supports <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a>, searching for GIFs via the <a href="https://developers.giphy.com/">GIPHY API</a>, then posting those as the "photo" property in a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub">Micropub</a> form-encoded request. It also supports <a href="https://indieweb.org/in-reply-to">in-reply-to</a> functionality, putting the "reaction" into "GIF Reaction", though there's no UI for that, yet. He made an <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/04/10/193815/">example reply post</a>, but <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/indieweb/hwc-2018-03-07-wrap-up/#comment-439">Jonathan's post</a> doesn't seem to support <a href="https://indieweb.org/photo_reply">photo replies</a>. 🤔 Also fixed up some <a href="https://indieweb.org/metacrap">metacrap</a> for his <a href="https://wehavetoask.com/">podcast site</a> so sharing looks better on Facebook and Twitter.
  <br />

<p>
  <a href="http://rhearamakrishnan.com/">rhearamakrishnan.com</a> – Working on a redesign of her site. Making good use of view-source on sites that she likes for inspiration. Working on a mixed media art project with post cards that direct you to a website that contains coordinates to a geo cache containing an actual letter.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – Been doing lots of work stuff that overlaps with personal web interests. Working on his wedding page. It's now up on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and uses their form collection for RSVPs.</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The new <a href="http://killerqueenarcade.com/">Killer Queen</a> 5 vs 5 arcade game recently installed in Baltimore at <a href="https://www.holyfrijoles.net/">Holy Frijoles</a>.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Baltimore zine culture (apparently <a href="https://atomicbooks.com/">Atomic Books</a> considers carrying local zines).</li>
  <li><a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine</a> for creating interactive poetry and fiction. It outputs a bunch of HTML and CSS (and maybe JS) that can be hosted anywhere.</li>
  <li>The Netlify static site model of separating content management, storage, layout and rendering, and file hosting.</li>
  <li>The difficulty in evaluating "frameworks" like React and Vue based on their low-level merits. Looking at community and availability of higher-level components might help more.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  After a postponement due to snows on the first day of spring, Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-03-27-homebrew-website-club">second Homebrew Website Club of March</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on March 27th. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – Talked about his <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/reflection/learning-and-project-update-march-11-2018/">recent experiments with Netlify and JAMstack</a>. Had been researching static site hosting services for a while and found a lot of hype. After playing w/ <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> he feels like it lives up to the hype! Was specifically interested in a static site generator called <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>, which uses the <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> front-end framework to render content.</p>
<p><a href="https://derekfields.is">derekfields.is</a> – Been building a blog section for his site on a static site generator called <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>. Found the theming stuff to be confusing and time-consuming, but has something working. Will eventually replace the theme with his own as he understands it more. Really likes the Hexo admin composer and compared with the editor for <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>. Feels like the features help him write. Also setting up a <a href="https://now.sh/">Now.sh</a> tiny server for a subdomain to host <a href="https://vuejs.org/">VueJS</a> apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://brksavage.com/">brksavage.com</a> – Set a goal to do something creative and post about it every month. Did a big project for February (created a desk-sized piece filled w/ the word "bored"). Now writing it up and thinking about ways to make it easier to publish in the future.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dariusmccoy.com/">www.dariusmccoy.com</a> – Still building up momentum on his Wordpress site. Had a scare that he was locked out of his admin but got back in. Now that he has a working site, he is setting goals for himself about what he wants that site to have and how he wants to present himself there.</p>
<p>
  Robert (<a href="https://gnostech.net/">gnostech.net</a>) – Working on owning his data. Has a <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> service set up on his domain, where he can access all his data from his phone and more. Has been taking lots of notes about his home set up (Nextcloud, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>, ad filtering firewall at home, and more). Wants to build a blog to share both how-tos on what he has set up and how, but also the way he decided on his particular needs. Has been using <a href="https://www.nas4free.org/">NAS4Free</a> to have more control over his home network storage.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – Is finally back after missing several HWCs. He has definitely missed them! Talked about the need for indie readers that allow reading and posting reactions to personal sites all in one. Demo'd <a href="https://alltogethernow.io/">Together</a>, and <a href="https://monocle.p3k.io/">Monocle</a> <a href="https://indieweb.org/Microsub">Microsub</a> clients as well as Aperture for Microsub server to handle all the nitty-gritty of fetching and parsing feeds.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Derek started us off with a really nice warm-up. We took turns with each person sharing compliments/thanks/encouragement about things people are working on and/or doing for and/or learning from one another. (This was seriously really nice).
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    JAMstack (Javascript, APIs, Markup). Name was coined because some "static" sites have lots of dynamic functionality.
    <ul>
      <li>Jonathan gave a demo of Netlify serving pages from a GitHub repo. Talked about how lots of different workflows can be used to manage content (e.g. Ghost, Netlify CMS, etc) without worrying about the final step of compiling the source into HTML and serving those static pages. Netlify has tons of features in the free tier (SSL with Let's Encrypt, support for forms, and more).</li>
      <li>Q: How do they make money? A: Great question! They're advertised all over the place in the web design world. Maybe consulting? For example, they did a huge redesign for Smashing Magazine.</li>
      <li>Q: Do we have to use GitHub? A: That's all Jonathan has played with so far, but they probably support other source control services.</li>
      <li>Q: What content goes in the Git repo? A: The source content, templates, etc. E.g. the output of "hexo init".</li>
      <li>Q: How does the DNS setup work? A: Netlify gives you IP addresses and you point A records at them. Same way you would for a Digital Ocean droplet or other virtual server.</li>
      <li>With custom domains, pulling content from GitHub, and tools like the (also free) Netlify CMS that ease editing, this could be a strong competitor for e.g. Wordpress.com sites, barring some initial setup pain.</li>
      <li>Was able to replace FormSpree service with Netlify's free form handling service. He can see the submitted form data by logging into his Netlify account.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Talked about recent creepy Facebook news and <a href="https://cleverdevil.io/2018/freeing-myself-from-facebook">efforts like cleverdevil's to escape it with our content intact</a>. Marty was inspired by that to grab his Facebook content with <a href="https://github.com/danburzo/fb-export">fb-export</a> and the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/downalbum/cgjnhhjpfcdhbhlcmmjppicjmgfkppok">DownAlbum extension for Chrome</a>.</li>
  <li>If Facebook goes away or runs into issues, what happens to projects like React or their other open source projects?</li>
  <li>Would a giant like Amazon step up? What would an Amazon social network look like?</li>
  <li>If Facebook actually "falls" (however unlikely), would another centralized social network "win"? Probably!</li>
</ul>

<p>🎧 Listened to &ldquo;An Indieweb Podcast Episode 0&rdquo; by <a href="https://david.shanske.com/">David Shanske</a> and <a href="https://boffosocko.com/">Chris Aldrich</a>.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed this pilot episode! I was particularly interested in some of the discussion around annotations for audio. I think I&rsquo;ll spend some time noodling on using <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2018/03/10/open-web-annotation-of-audio-and-video/">Jon Udell&rsquo;s clipping tool</a> to generate shareable snippet URLs, and updating my webmention handling to try and turn mentions with media fragment timestamps into pretty annotations.</p>

    <div class="post e-content">
<p>This post gives more technical detail for the <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/03/12/110809/">recent talk that I gave at Bring-a-Hack NYC</a>. In it, I describe a system that copies posts from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ghostpartyimprov/">Ghost Party's Instagram</a> automatically to the <a href="https://ghostparty.today/">Ghost Party Website at ghostparty.today</a>.</p>
<p>This roughly works like so:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://ownyourgram.com/">OwnYourGram</a> periodically checks our Instagram for new images
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>For each new post, it makes a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub">Micropub</a> request to a service that I wrote for this purpose.</li>
  <li>The endpoint accepts the image files and uploads them to our site using the Neocities API. Then it creates some new HTML from the micropub post data, edits the site's main index.html page to include the content, then uploads it back to Neocities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Authorization with IndieAuth</h2>
<p>One missing step in that rough outline is the bit where we tell OwnYourGram *how* to post to our site via Micropub, as well as making sure that OwnYourGram can prove that we have given it permission to post there. Many Micropub clients support <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a> as a way to do this permission-granting step (known as authorization). With a typical personal website, I'd delegate this process to <a href="https://indieauth.com/">indieauth.com</a>, which lets you offload the step of "proving" that you own the website where you're trying to post by instead letting you log into an existing social network account.</p>
<p>ghostparty.today is a shared website, so I thought a simpler way to approach this would be to create a custom authorization endpoint that accepts a password. I could give this password to other GHOST PARTY folks and they can post whatever they like.</p>
<p>Some nice folks in the IndieWeb community had already created an authorization endpoint that works this way, called <a href="https://github.com/Inklings-io/selfauth">selfauth</a>. I created a pretty simplistic port of selfauth from PHP to JavaScript using NodeJS on the awesome <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch social code hosting platform</a>. It needs some more robust error checking, and some micropub clients seem to have trouble with it, but it works with OwnYourGram and <a href="https://quill.p3k.io/">Quill</a>, so it's Good Enough for now!</p>
<figure><img src="https://media.martymcgui.re/bd/bd/da/dd/6e6c4655bdc084b099c73340eefc5caf76d235ba7f403ac47ecc6730.png" alt="Interface displaying text 'You are attempting to login as https://ghostparty.today/ with client https://quill.p3k.io/' along with a password prompt." /><figcaption>Enter the password to get authorized!</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're interested, you can find the source for this endpoint here: <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/befitting-price">https://glitch.com/edit/#!/befitting-price</a></p>
<h2>Micropub Endpoint</h2>
<p>Finally, there's the Micropub endpoint itself. I based mine off of <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/crocus-garlic">this Glitch micropub project</a>, created by <a href="https://adambachman.org/">Adam Bachman</a> at <a href="https://indieweb.org/2018/Baltimore">IndieWebCamp Baltimore</a> this year. Specfically, I took the bits that verify the access token. From there, it was a matter of stumbling through various bits of handling a Micropub post, pulling in extra libraries as I needed them. I slowly added support for saving uploaded files to our Neocities site via the Neocities API, then for generating an HTML snippet for the new post, and finally for adding the post to the site's main page.</p>
<p>The process for adding the generated post content to the site itself is extremely retro. The Micropub endpoint actually downloads the HTML from https://ghostparty.today/index.html. Inside there is a comment that looks like:</p>
<pre>&lt;!-- NEW POSTS BELOW --&gt;</pre>
<p>So the new contents for index.html is everything before the comment, the comment, the new content, and then everything after the comment. Once that's constructed, the endpoint uploads index.html back to Neocities with the new contents.</p>
<p>
  You can find the source for the Micropub endpoint here: <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/prism-dirt">https://glitch.com/edit/#!/prism-dirt</a>
  <br />
</p>
<p>It should be possible to fork the project on Glitch and configure it to work with your own Neocities site! You'll need to use cURL with the Neocities API to generate an authorization token to configure the app, rather than saving username and password info in the project!</p>
<h2>Making ghostparty.today "IndieWeb-Readable"</h2>
<p>The GHOST PARTY site follows an extremely old-school publishing model where each post <i>only</i> exists as a small section of HTML on a single long page. This complicates things a bit because interacting with posts on the IndieWeb typically requires three things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A machine-readable "identity" <a href="https://indieweb.org/h-card">h-card</a> that says "who" this website is, including a logo, the site name, canonical URL.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>A machine-readable <a href="https://indieweb.org/h-feed">feed</a> that contains new posts, allowing people to follow our updates in their favorite <a href="https://indieweb.org/reader">indie reader</a>.</li>
  <li>A separate permalink URL for each post, containing <a href="https://indieweb.org/h-entry">machine-readable info about that post</a>, allowing other IndieWeb sites to "understand" the content when they want to RSVP to events, repost or like photos, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Microformats2 parsers like <a href="https://xray.p3k.io/">X-Ray</a> do a great job at parsing HTML page into meaningful data, but the programs that use the parsed data usually stop at the first thing they find. So, if I ask X-Ray to <a href="https://xray.p3k.io/parse?url=https%3A%2F%2Fghostparty.today%2F">parse https://ghostparty.today</a>/, this is what it sees:</p>
<pre>{
  "data":{
    "type":"card",
    "name":"GHOST PARTY",
    "url":"https://ghostparty.today/",
    "photo":"https://ghostparty.neocities.org/ghost-party-logo.png"
  },
  "url":"https://ghostparty.today/",
  "code":200
}</pre>
<p>This is great in that it contains the "identity" information that we want the page to have. However, that page also has a feed! How can I get at that? By telling X-Ray to only look at a <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Fragment.html">fragment of the page</a>! Here's how X-Ray <a href="https://xray.p3k.io/parse?url=https%3A%2F%2Fghostparty.today%2F%23feed">sees https://ghostparty.today/#feed</a>: </p>
<pre>{
  "data":{
    "type":"feed",
    "items":[
      {
        "type":"entry",
        "published":"2018-03-07T16:44:16+00:00",
        "url":"https://ghostparty.today/#2018-03-07-181020",
        "photo":["https://ghostparty.today/uploads/2018-03-07/181020-ig0LN1JG.jpg"],
        "content":{"text":"snow day selfie #snowday #snowfie #ghoststories"} 
      },
      {
        "type":"entry",
        ...
      },
      ...
    ],
    "url":"https://ghostparty.today/#feed",
    "code":200,
    "info":{"found_fragment":true}
  }
}</pre>
<p>
  Data! Nice! So if we want to follow ghostparty.today with an indie reader, we use <code>https://ghostparty.today/#feed</code> as the URL.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Looking at the content of the feed, you'll notice that the individual items have a url property which <i>also</i> has a fragment ID in the URL. This allows IndieWeb sites to interact with a particular post, even though it's one of many on the same page. For example, I was able to <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/01/31/224122/">create an RSVP post to the most recent Ghost Party show</a>, and (by looking just at the content in the fragment at <code>https://ghostparty.today/#show-2018-02-14</code>) my site was able to pick up the machine-readable details about the event to display them on my own site.</p>
<p>The microformats markup for the h-card and h-feed are built into the index.html file itself and don't change very often. However, for each new micropub post we need to convert those properties into a chunk of HTML for the index.html page that <i>also</i> contains the microformats h-entry markup. To do this, I made <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/prism-dirt?path=views/entry.handlebars:1:0">this Handlebars template</a>:</p>
<pre><code>{% raw %}&lt;div class="h-entry" id="{{ mp-slug }}"&gt;
  &lt;a class="u-author" href="/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a class="u-url" href="#{{ mp-slug }}"&gt;{{#if name}}&lt;h2 class="p-name"&gt;{{ name }}&lt;/h2&gt;{{/if}}&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;time class="dt-published" datetime="{{ published }}"&gt;&lt;/time&gt;
  {{#if video}}
    {{#each video}}
      &lt;video controls loop class="u-video" src="{{ . }}"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
    {{/each}}
  {{ else }}
    {{#each photo}}
      &lt;img class="u-photo" src="{{ . }}" /&gt;
    {{/each}}
    {{#each audio}}
      &lt;audio class="u-audio" src="{{ . }}"&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
    {{/each}}
  {{/if}}
  &lt;div class="e-content"&gt;{{ content }}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img src="ghosts.gif" /&gt;
{% endraw %}</code></pre>
<p>Not so bad!</p>

<p>This post is a rough summary of a lightning talk that I gave on February 28th at the <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/02/23/next-week-bring-a-hack-in-nyc/">Bring-A-Hack NYC with Hackaday + Ultimaker + New Lab</a>. Many thanks to Shayna Gentiluomo for organizing and sometimes co-conspirator <a href="https://mfgriffin.com/">Matt Griffin</a> for nudging me to speak!</p>
<hr />
<p>I have a lot of distrust for social silos like Facebook and Twitter which draw us in with the promise of connecting with family, friends, and interesting people, but I sometimes have trouble articulating that in a succinct way. Thankfully, I saw a perfect example this morning:</p>
<blockquote>Posting on the @facebook website is not working in Mac OS today. JavaScript eats CSS &amp; HTML, making data entry field disappear except for a spookily disembodied close-box X. Been this way a few hours. — <a href="https://twitter.com/zeldman">@zeldman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/zeldman/status/968861672541708290">9:53 AM - 28 Feb 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>Some Facebook team pushed an (untested?) update which broke the website, preventing some users from posting. "Move fast and break things". These silos don't value us or our content. So, we should get out. But what is the alternative?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> helps us take our content back, by posting to our own websites on our own domains. With some work, we can even get the benefits of these social networks and take our conversations with us. There’s a whole lot of great stuff on the IndieWeb website, so <a href="https://indieweb.org/Getting_Started">go spend a couple of days reading it</a>. But I’m not here to talk about all those good things today. I’m here to talk about how I used them to do a dumb hack.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://ghostparty.today/">ghostparty.today</a> is a website for Ghost Party – an improv project that has a ... certain aesthetic. Specifically the website was pitched as “exactly like the Heaven’s Gate website” but we compromised on “extreme Geocities”.</p>
<p></p>
<figure><img src="https://media.martymcgui.re/09/a1/ac/48/9365fceee9147050b56175762179446084558b2611bec008d03146ed.png" alt="Ugly large text says 'Welcome to GHOST PARTY'" /><figcaption>We have an aesthetic.</figcaption></figure>
<p>My Ghost Party co-host (co-ghost) built the first version of the site on <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities.org</a>, a lovely hosting provider that recaptures the feel of editing raw HTML directly in your browser. However, hand-editing HTML gets exhausting and sometimes you just want to post things to Instagram (and, of course,  <a href="https://instagram.com/ghostpartyimprov/">Ghost Party has an Instagram</a>).</p>
<p>And Instagram is fine as a marketing platform! Lots of people look at it and like the pictures. But what about our website? <i>Our aesthetic</i>?</p>
<p><a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub">Micropub</a> is a standard (and now W3C Recommendation) designed over some years of practice from the IndieWeb community that defines a way for apps and clients to easily make new posts to any website (even yours) if it supports Micropub.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>, an amazing community and JavaScript-server-app hosting service, to make a simple micropub service for ghostparty.today.</p>
<p></p>
<figure><img src="https://media.martymcgui.re/9c/e4/3b/6a/2acaa5622a3129066fbe2cccae3e41bbaa56db82ff3d0eff51f9e2ed.png" alt="Screenshot of code in the Glitch UI"/></figure>
<p>It accepts posts via micropub, including file uploads, and uses the Neocities API (hey, it’s not the 90s! Neocities has an API!) to upload the files to our website. Then, it fetches our site’s index.html, adds the content of the new post, and uploads it back. <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/prism-dirt">You can find the source here on Glitch and fork it for your own purposes</a>!</p>
<p>Now that our site supports micropub, we can make use of a wonderful service called <a href="https://ownyourgram.com/">OwnYourGram</a>. Once we give OwnYourGram permission to post to our site and read our Instagram feed, it will poll our Instagram account and copy each new post back to our website, where we can display it however we want.</p>
<figure><img src="https://media.martymcgui.re/2c/fe/90/e7/881eb3e2066c4fe6230eb7f6005921d22ff1691171c389dc92f2527f.png" alt="Super simplified Instagram photo on Ghost Party website"/><figcaption>Aesthetic</figcaption></figure>
<p>We can go a step further, using an IndieWeb building block called <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">Webmention</a> and a service called <a href="https://brid.gy/">brid.gy</a>, to bring all of those responses, those Instagram and Facebook likes and comments, Twitter retweets, and more, back to our site for display.</p>
<p>And to show how it works, here’s a micropub client call <a href="https://quill.p3k.io/">Quill</a> that works for any micropub-enabled site. Let’s make a quick post, now!</p>
<figure><img src="https://media.martymcgui.re/50/c3/e5/91/56ecb23b74abdd71f8a31a41040a321dbd94b70b8da981dd954a11ae.png" alt="Posting interface with 'Hello from New Lab' typed into note field"/><figcaption>Quill's note interface</figcaption></figure>
<p>Once we hit the "Post" button and refresh the homepage, we can see the new post on the site!</p>
<figure><img src="https://media.martymcgui.re/82/0a/5e/fc/19b83c42948ee8517be2677de6f120ba374aeb0ed1d5343ba053409f.png" alt="'Hello from New Lab' text with ghost separator image" /><figcaption><em>Aesthetic</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This was the end of time time. I would have like to further encourage folks to check out <a href="https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club">Homebrew Website Club</a>s in their own communities, or to start one if they don't exist. They're part show-and-tell, part support group, and part mad science lab for people who love the web!</p>

<p>
  Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-02-06-homebrew-website-club">first Homebrew Website Club of February</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on February 6th.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  jonathanprozzi.net – Productive 2 weeks! Has a personal notes site running on Hugo on a subdomain after some adventures with git publishing hooks and a bug with themes that was causing it to render only as XML. Set up a separate site with Hugo and <a href="https://revealjs.com/">Reveal.JS</a> and might be interested in that for IndieWeb-related learning activities going forward. Has been tracking everything he is writing, taking notes in his personal notes site as he goes so he can either clean them up for real posts, or just publish the notes. Worked tonight on more activity content on his personal notes site. Troubleshooting microformats on his main site WP theme. Also interested in <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">GatsbyJS</a> plus a WordPress backend... maybe? Also working with Gulp to make a build tool for P5.js sketches.
  <br />
</p>
<p>dariusmccoy.com – Tonight moved his domain from WordPress.com to Hover. Waiting on that to finish so he can set up new hosting and move his site in general off of WordPress.com onto a WordPress.org site which has more flexibility. Thinking about the direction of his site - resume / portfolio, or blogging, or posting his photography. Could blog personal projects, maybe sports blogging but worried about trolls.</p>
<p>derekfields.is – Set up his GitHub pages site to serve from his custom domain. Also put up a <a href="https://medium.com/@DJFalcon23/guardrails-vr-from-a-microcontroller-e765c2874c3f">post about serving A-Frame virtual worlds from an ESP8266 microcontroller</a> on Medium. Working on a PESOS copy of his post back to his site. Wants to work on a couple more posts for next time.</p>
<p>bouhmad.com – Working on bringing his site back up. Something went wrong on the virtual server running it and he is reinstalling and reconfiguring things. Has a blog post ready to go once the site is back up. (He got it back up before the end of HWC!)</p>
<p>martymcgui.re – Been working on IndieWeb-ifying some project websites, most recently <a href="https://ghostparty.today/">ghostparty.today</a>. It's a single HTML page hosted on Neocities that his improv partner created at IndieWebCamp Baltimore. It's an experiment in nesting microformats and permalinks, making use of links with anchors (<a href="https://ghostparty.today/#show-2018-02-14">example event</a>, <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/01/31/224122/">example RSVP</a>). Also added mf2 markup to the site for his D&amp;D livestreaming show (<a href="https://dndsvu.rpg.academy/episodes/cs04p1/">example</a>, <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/02/02/130233/">example reply</a>) so he could reshare things on his site. Is excited about making a micropub server for the Neocities site as a goof, probably running on <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. Something like "IndieWeb like it's 1999".</p>
<p>Other things: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Falcon Heavy test launch happened today and wow! We could not find a reference for the projected final orbit of the payload (a Tesla with a mannequin wearing a SpaceX space suit)
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbSwFU6tY1c">livestream video</a> was interesting. It offered multiple camera views, switchable with a "Switch Camera" button in the YouTube UI. The main view was the public facing talking-head discussion, telemetry displays, etc. The other was a static camera with audio direct from mission control.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Transferring domains from WordPress.com is interesting. Apparently the registrar is listed as wildwestdomains.com?
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Managing DigitalOcean droplets is hard when you lose your SSH private keys.</li>
  <li><a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> as a fun way to sketch in code. <a href="https://neocities.org/api">Neocities has an API</a>.</li>
  <li>Really clever onboarding process on Glitch. Log in with your GitHub and it shows a welcome page with "Start New Project" and "Resume Coding" buttons. Even if you have never used Glitch before, clicking "Resume Coding" will take you to a new Hello World project. Nice!</li>
  <li>DigitalOcean recently(?) updated their pricing so that lower tiers are much better! You have to walk through a process to stop each droplet, resize it, and start it back up.</li>
  <li>The Brackets editor has a <a href="https://github.com/torcado194/Brackets-Confetti">Confetti</a> plugin and it is very eye-catching.</li>
  <li>.meme is a pending TLD??? Also talked .bot premiums on shorter domain names.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/blog/2470-introducing-security-alerts-on-github">GitHub Security Alerts</a> now send out weekly emails. Maybe only for some accounts or types of vulnerability, but Marty has been receiving them about some old projects.</li>
  <li>JAMstack, the attractive bits about "reusable APIs" the dangers of those same APIs belonging to third-parties out of your control.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to everybody who came out! We hope to see you all again at our next meeting on <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-02-20-homebrew-website-club">February 20th</a>, which is a Tuesday!</p>

    <div class="post e-content">
<p>Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-01-23-homebrew-website-club">second Homebrew Website Club of January</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on January 23rd.</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Been catching up on things since IndieWebCamp! Spent tonight writing the <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/01/23/191137/">first of several wrap-up posts</a>. Also finally got the weekend's <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/01/23/120410/">episode of This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition</a> up this morning, ~3 days late. Planning to write more specific wrap-ups, open up some old Micropub and IndieAuth python projects he needs to update.</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> — Recently finished a draft of a 45-60 minute activity for new folks to HWC to register their first domain. None of tonight's attendee's need a domain, so we'll punt on that for next time. Spent the time tonight setting up a notebook.jonathanprozzi.net subdomain to be a publicly accessible version of the Hugo site that he set up recently to take notes. He used it over the weekend at IWC Baltimore and now wants it available on his phone. He also subscribed to all the IWC Baltimore attendees on <a href="https://woodwind.xyz/">Woodwind</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://derekfields.is/">derekfields.is</a> — Working on VR world project where the server is a microcontroller with sensors that can directly manipulate the VR world. Dealing w/ issues serving an A-Frame VR web app from his nodemcu microcontroller. The nodemcu serves a big opaque string for content and he wants to have it load A-Frame and other third-party resources from a CDN. The trouble is that when your computer is connected to the nodemcu's access point, there is no access to the internet. He is looking at another possibility of serving those minified scripts directly from the nodemcu.</p>
<p><a href="http://angelosresu.me/">angelosresu.me</a> — Just noticed his website is down, oops. Not been working on his site much. Has been working on setting up his first OAuth implementation at work.</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/2018/Baltimore">Baltimore had our own IndieWebCamp</a>! It was great! Videos are available now for all Saturday sessions as well as Sunday morning intros and afternoon demos.</li>
  <li><a href="https://snarfed.org/1-million-webmentions">1 Million Webmentions</a>!</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/">WebSub is a W3C REC</a>!</li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/indieauth/">IndieAuth is a W3C Note!</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Lots of discussion about what IndieAuth is, vs RelMeAuth, PGP</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>W3C governance is interesting! And confusing!</li>
  <li>Showed off Woodwind as an example of IndieAuth dance. Also got Jonathan set up with Micropub via Woodwind so he can send replies.</li>
  <li>Open Graph Protocol, microformats</li>
  <li>Moving the idea of computing out of the default idea of a screen and keyboard/mouse/touch and a bunch of storage and computing right in front of you into more interesting paradigms like little internet-connected microcontrollers, virtual worlds.</li>
  <li>The idea of needing indie readers to start consolidating how people can read and respond to IndieWeb content as easily as on silos. We may all be asking <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">Aaron</a> for accounts on Monocle.</li>
</ul>

  <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-02-06-homebrew-website-club">February 6th</a> (Note: this is a Tuesday). We'll have a new activity for new folks during this meeting starting at 6:30pm – getting started with web hosting!</li>

<p>Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-12-12-homebrew-website-club">December meetup for Homebrew</a> Website Club met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on December 12th.</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – Went to <a href="https://2017.indieweb.org/austin">IndieWebCamp Austin</a>, and it was great! Some notes on that below. <a href="https://2018.indieweb.org/baltimore">IndieWebCamp Baltimore</a> is scheduled and people are RSVPing and booking plane tickets, so he is very excited! The schedule now appears to be locked in and it's time to market it hard. Also demo'd the way he shows multiphoto posts on his site with CSS Grid (<a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/12/10/194648/">example</a>). 2018-01-01 commitments progress: super happy with IWC Baltimore progress, expects to cut is close with <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/11/26/162135/">his commitment</a> to move his site to Hugo by 2018.</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://brksavage.com/">brksavage.com</a> – Been working on a crash course in WordPress, HTML, kind of overloaded on it. Tonight worked on another project because of writer's block.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://djfalcon23.github.io/">derekfields.is</a> – Been geeking out on <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/">codrops</a> – really nice visualizations and animations on the web with SVG, WebGL, and more. So pretty! Adding a blog page to his site (by hand). Researching how to incorporate Ghost into his site. Started a <a href="http://www.100daysofcode.com/">100 Days of Code project</a>! Similar to <a href="https://indieweb.org/100DaysOfIndieWeb">100 Days of IndieWeb</a>, the goal is to get an hour of coding done every day and tweet your progress. Missed a couple of days over the weekend, but enjoys sharing out his progress and the community support. Would like to have a buddy to support each other. 2018-01-01 commitment progress: working on apostrophe and a cloud service to host it, downloaded Ubuntu tools for Windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://bouhmad.com/">bouhmad.com</a> – Site is down at the moment. Needs to get it back up and on HTTPS. Wants to do a blog post on experiences as being a dual full-time student and full-time employee out of high school, and the "full college experience". 2018-01-01 commitments: wants to get that blog post up, would like to commit to blogging at least once every two weeks in the new year capturing projects as a resource to others but also daily life as an archive for his future self.</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/reflection/2018-01-01-commitments/">2018-01-01 commitments</a>: little progress on his pre-2018 commitment but still thinks he has time. Really wants to get his local WordPress + git setup going soon. A new near term goal: RSVP to IWC Baltimore!
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other Things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Bitcoin! Coinbase! GDAX! How unreal the value is right now and how unusable it all is.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/2017/Austin">IndieWebCamp Austin</a>! Marty went and loved it. We went looked at the <a href="https://indieweb.org/2017/Austin/Schedule">Sessions Grid</a> and talked about each one at a high level.</li>
  <li>Talked about the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/">WordPress Post Kinds</a> plugin and how it might be useful to have a series of blog posts that explains how to get the most out of this plugin, tying that into details about the different types on the wiki and so on.</li>
  <li>Talked a lot about IndieWebCamp Baltimore. It's shaping up to be very exciting! Aaron Parecki got the event and wiki pages looking good, so now we want to start getting the word out everywhere.</li>
  <li><a href="https://wordpress.tv/2017/12/10/brianna-privett-the-story-of-your-life-using-wordpress-as-your-memory-warehouse/">Brianna Privett</a> talk about using WordPress as a life log.</li>
  <li>Ways to put WordPress development into git, like <a href="https://roots.io/">Bedrock/Trellis</a>, putting the whole site in version control, organizing child themes, etc.</li>
  <li>CSS Grid! It seems like magic!</li>
  <li>2017 was an amazing year for HWC Baltimore. Thanks to everyone who made it a success. We can't wait to see everyone again and made an awesome 2018!</li>
</ul>

<p>As someone who spends a lot of time in the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> community, I spend a lot of time opening up various pages that I know are there. At times it feels tedious to open a new tab and type out the full URL.</p>
<p>I'm not alone in this! Folks that hang out in the <a href="https://indieweb.org/discuss">IndieWeb chat</a>, often use the <a href="https://indieweb.org/Loqi#Wiki">"what is x?" wiki lookup</a> feature of our friendly IRC bot Loqi.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>, the launcher and general magic quick bar for macOS, I thought I could save myself some time by making a Workflow to open those pages for me.</p>
<p>
The Workflow itself does only one thing: When you open Alfred (⌘-spacebar), type "iw KEYWORD" and press Enter, it opens https://indieweb.org/KEYWORD in your browser.

<p>It&rsquo;s time to make IndieWeb commitments for 2018!</p>

<p>I commit to hosting an <a href="https://indieweb.org/Planning#Baltimore">IndieWebCamp in Baltimore</a> in 2018. I hope to knock this out pretty early in the year, actually! My co-host <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">Jonathan Prozzi</a> and I will be choosing a date in the next week or so, based on the feedback we have received so far.</p>

<p>I also want to work on a new design for my site and to contribute more <a href="https://micropub.net/">Micropub</a>-based tools for other folks to use on their IndieWeb sites. To that end, by 2018-01-01 I hope to finish reworking much of my site&rsquo;s automation and deployment to replace my current <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> configuration, which relies heavily on custom plugins that run on every compile and takes about a minute to rebuild the site. I aim to replace the core static site generation with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, and to replace custom plugin logic with tiny services that run only when posts are created or updated, along the lines of <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/morris">morris</a>, a simple receiver that stores <a href="https://webmention.net/">webmentions</a> from <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmention.io</a> in data files that static site generators like Hugo (and Jekyll) can consume.</p>

<p>For comparison, I looked up <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2016/11/30/185757/">my (vague) commitment for last year</a> which I easily met but was so vague about that I never posted it. I <em>think</em> I was cleaning up my Jekyll configuration to pre-compute metadata about images and other files in my posts. I would end up scrapping that in January when I <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/01/26/122700/">switched to a micropub media endpoint</a> for hosting my uploads.</p>

<p>
  Baltimore's <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/11/13/120157/">second November 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on November 15th.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – Is back after lots of travel and writing a post about that, including a roadmap of getting back into things. Archived several posts from his old Hugo site into his new WordPress site. One of his 2018-01-01 goals is to practice posting status updates to his site instead of Facebook.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://brksavage.com/">brksavage.com</a> – Bought a new domain for a blog a couple of months ago, transferring it to BlueHost now. Been looking over old content. A 2018-01-01 commitment: small goal - write something small and publish it before end of year.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://derekfields.is/">derekfields.is</a> – Working on getting a JavaScript-based CMS called <a href="http://apostrophecms.org/">apostrophe.js</a> working for his site. Probably going to host it on Heroku. Also learning the Windows subsystem for Linux, because developing on Windows "doesn't feel right" since he's not using .NET or similar.</p>
<p><a href="https://bouhmad.com/">bouhmad.com</a> – Working on a first post to go up tonight! Realized the original scope for his "first post", which was going to compare multiple host-based intrusion detection systems, was going to take weeks! So, he's starting off with one, then planning to get back to it after he graduates (hopefully!) in December.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – Been working on a new way to store and display webmentions on his site. Currently has one site that pulls them from webmention.io with JavaScript, and one site that polls webmention.io for new mentions every time it is compiled by Jekyll. Started building a webhook in Python but has now moved to PHP because it should be simpler. </p>
<p><a href="https://dariusmccoy.com/">dariusmccoy.com</a> – Just got started with his domain, just a landing page. Wants to add more content to it.</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    IndieWeb <a href="https://indieweb.org/2018-01-01-commitments">2018-01-01 Commitments</a>.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tessalt/echo-chamber-js/blob/master/readme.md">echo-chamber.js</a> - a fake commenting system that stores comments in the browser, so the commenter (and no one else) can see what they are saying.</li>
  <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/2018/Baltimore">IndieWebCamp Baltimore 2018</a>! We talked about what an IndieWebCamp is and how it is structured.</li>
  <li>IoT and the IndieWeb (mentioned the <a href="https://indieweb.org/2017/iw4hw">IndieWebSummit session on IndieWeb for Hardware</a>).</li>
  <li>Twitter and Facebook business models and how they benefit from outrage.</li>
  <li>IndieWeb generations, specifically the way that participating in the IndieWeb right now almost requires you to be a developer.</li>
  <li>The creepiness of Amazon Key.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Thanks to everybody who came out! We look forward to seeing you at the Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center for the next one! We'll be meeting again on <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-11-29-homebrew-website-club">November 29th</a>.

<p>
  Baltimore's <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/10/23/224415/">first November 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on November 1st. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://bouhmad.com/">bouhmad.com</a> – Been working on a big post about security issues. Also, collecting resources for an <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Charm-City-Net-Tech/events/244116726/">Equifax-breach-themed CryptoParty in November</a>, which will also go on his site.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://djfalcon23.github.io/">djfalcon23.github.io</a> – Buying his dream domain (TBA once it is registered). Been reading lots about getting into tech industry, dealing w/ impostor syndrome. Planning to turn some of these into notes and/or posts on his site when it is up.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – Posted up the <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/10/31/230504/">last IWC NYC 2017 interview (with Tantek)</a>. Would like to have one per week to put up, so will bring his mic to next HWC Baltimore, and may start asking people in IRC to do interviews over Skype, Zencaster, or similar. Also just reached the <a href="https://wehavetoask.com/episodes/2017-10-31/">100th episode of his comedy podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Other things.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Worries about Net Neutrality and the upcoming FCC proposals to break it by allowing pay-for-access fees to publishers. We looked at resources like <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/">battleforthenet.com</a> and a <a href="https://twitter.com/coton_luver/status/924306977458593792">video from Congressional Democrats about the issue</a>.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Podcasts about tech. Derek has been trying to find podcasts about cutting-edge tech, but been frustrated. For example, Friends Talk Frontend has good content, but he finds the hosts annoying. Adam recommend Talk Python to Me because it is funny and timely, focusing on new tech. Marty recommends the Contrafubilists because it is kind of an anti-cutting-edge tech podcast with very thoughtful hosts that take apart the marketing speak behind technology trends.</li>
  <li>Also got off into the weeds about good story-driven podcasts. 😅</li>
  <li>Talked about a theoretical "disruptive student" detection system that uses computer vision, motion detection, face recognition, to log "overactive" students and generate reports. Generated a lot of interesting discussion about unintended consequences of technologically "simple" systems.</li>
  <li>Talked about the problems of trying to digitize the rules of complex human systems and the problems of measuring outcomes, determining what "just" algorithms looks like, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Thanks to everybody who came out! We look forward to seeing you at the Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center for the next one! We'll be meeting again on <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-11-15-homebrew-website-club">November 15th</a> and <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-11-29-homebrew-website-club">November 29th</a>.

  Baltimore's <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/09/25/174529/">second October 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on October 4th.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Recently <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/10/17/205701/">posted about his IWC NYC hack day project</a> - showing subtitle and caption tracks for audio files in the browser by marking them up as a video element. Showed off his new personal site, a note-taking and planning site with an audience of one. It lives on his laptop and on a protected Tor hidden service so it can be read from his phone. Also been working on porting his podcast website to Hugo, learning how fragile his micropub server is about mapping URLs to flat files on the server.</p>
<p><a href="http://bouhmad.com/">bouhmad.com</a> — Started a new job recently, so been working to find time to work on his new site. Wrote an outline and a list of resources about what the site will be about and what content will be on it. Hoping to publish in the next two weeks!</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://maryreisenwitz.com/">maryreisenwitz.com</a> — Our venue host for the evening! Been writing a lot of stuff and working to organize it. Outlining story points for a narrative piece, consists of lots of dream pieces, which she has been logging for a few years. Been organizing those in Google Keep, cataloging and tagging them by time. Found it really interesting to look over her dream notes for this time past year. Also finding searching incredibly useful. "When did I dream about a horse? There are two dreams!"
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://rhearamakrishnan.com/">rhearamakrishnan.com</a> — Has a set of projects she wants to finish before updating her website. One of them is a podcast that will require lots of collaborative elements, so been planning that.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://angelosresu.me/">angelosresu.me</a> — Has been on the job search and realized he needed a website. It's currently a programming demo of a CAD app that uses <a href="http://paperjs.org/">Paper.js</a> and supports boolean operations over primitives.</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We talked about aligning audio/video content and content in a web page, like <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/learning/regex-golf-with-peter-norvig">this course on O'Reilly</a>. Would be useful for DHF's learning system courses. Could also be fun to have This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition show previews of the pages being discussed as they are being discussed.</li>
  <li>We discussed capturing notes with the lowest friction tools then moving them into more useful/durable systems later.</li>
  <li>We talked about podcasting tools. Dedicated recorders for in-the-field recording, Audacity for editing.</li>
  <li>We talked about the recent announcement from Adafruit's founder/owner/engineer ladyada finding herself <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/10/18/facebook-update-removed-facebook/">locked out of her Facebook account</a> with no apparently recourse. This led to general discussion of silos and monopolies, systems that are secretly bad for you because they stalk you or share you or your contacts' data, systems that are directly bad for you like Candy Crush and other addictive apps.</li>
  <li>Talked about some decentralized systems, like <a href="https://maidsafe.net/">MaidSafe</a> (decentralized p2p filestore, incentivized w/ a cryptocurrency), and Beaker's new <a href="https://louis.center/p2p-social-networking/">decentralized Twitter-alike Rotonde</a> (decentralized p2p websites, host it yourself or pay someone to mirror).</li>
</ul>

<p>
	This is a write-up of my Sunday hack day project from <a href="https://indieweb.org/2017/NYC">IndieWebCamp NYC 2017</a>!
  <br/>
	You can see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qan5Ipr4e0&feature=youtu.be&t=4m59s">my portion of the IWC NYC demos here</a>.
</p>
<h2>Prelude: Videos for audio content</h2>
<p>Feel free to <a href="#tldr">skip this intro</a> if you are just here for the HTML how-to!</p>
<p>I've been doing a short ~10 minute podcast about the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> community since February, an audio edition of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/this-week">This Week in the IndieWeb</a> weekly newsletter cleverly titled <a href="https://martymcgui.re/podcasts/indieweb/">This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition</a>.</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://2017.indieweb.org/">2017 IndieWeb Summit</a>, each episode of the podcast also featured a brief ~1 minute interview with one of the participants there. As a way of highlighting these interviews outside the podcast itself, I became interested in the idea of "audiograms" – videos that are primarily audio content for sharing on platforms like Twitter and Facebook. I wrote up <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/08/10/180614/">my first steps into audiograms using WNYC's audiogram generator</a>.</p>
<p>While these audiograms were able to show visually interesting dynamic elements like waveforms or graphic equalizer data, I thought it would be more interesting to include subtitles from the interviews in the videos. I learned that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/261764017354370?helpref=faq_content">Facebook supports captions</a> in a common format called SRT. However, Twitter's video offerings have no support for captions.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I discovered the <a href="https://github.com/BBC-News-Labs/audiogram">BBC's open source fork of audiogram</a>, which supports subtitles and captioning, including the ability to "bake in" subtitles by encoding the words directly into the video frames. It also relies heavily on BBC web infrastructure, and required quite a bit of hacking up to work with what I had available.</p>
<p><figure><img src="https://media.martymcgui.re/81/3d/cd/10/3d2b13a8173da7e2877a065e34c839de85c8ac0679f3336fab1542f5.png" /><figcaption>The BBC Audiogram captioning interface.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the end, my process looked like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Export the audio of the ~1 minute interview to an mp3.
  </li>
  <li>Type up a text transcript of the audio. Using <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>'s playback controls and turning the speed down to 0.33 made this pretty easy.</li>
  <li>Use a "forced alignment" tool called <a href="https://github.com/lowerquality/gentle/">gentle</a> to create a big JSON data file containing all the utterances and their timestamps.</li>
  <li>Use the <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> command line tool to munge that JSON data into a format that my hacked-up version of the BBC audiogram generator can understand.</li>
  <li>Use the BBC audiogram generator to edit the timings and word groupings for the subtitles and generate the final video.</li>
  <li>Bonus: the BBC audiogram generator can output subtitles in SRT format - but if I've already "baked them in" this feels redundant.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see an <a href="https://media.martymcgui.re/10/ef/8f/99/b181f11e199c00112d921955fd2bf5d78254ea0a9fef2a118aa37c30.mp4">early example here</a>. I liked these posts and found them easy to post to my site as well as Facebook, Twitter, Mastodon, etc. Over time I evolved them a bit to include more info about the interviewee. <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/09/12/115322/">Here's a later example</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that has stuck with me is the idea that Facebook could be displaying these subtitles, if only I was exporting them in the SRT format. Additionally, I had done some research into <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Fundamentals/Audio_and_video_delivery/Adding_captions_and_subtitles_to_HTML5_video">subtitles for HTML5 video with WebVTT and the &lt;track&gt; element</a> and wondered if it could work for audio content with some "tricks".</p>
<a name="tldr"></a>
<h2>TL;DR - Browsers will show captions for audio if you pretend it is a video</h2>
<p>Let's skip to the end and see what we're talking about. I wanted to make a version of my podcast where the entire ~10 minutes could be listened to along with timed subtitles, without creating a 10-minute long video. And I did!</p>
<p>Here is a sample from my <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/09/29/221157/">example post of an audio track inside an HTML5 &lt;video&gt; element with a subtitle track</a>. You will probably have to click the "<strong>CC</strong>" button to enable the captioning</p>
<p><video controls="" poster="https://media.martymcgui.re/6b/4c/75/34/e23d5c25dd43a47b16ec2668c7163f35ff6349bf26d734f4b448da75.png" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width: 100%" src="https://media.martymcgui.re/b0/c8/a5/07/df8ed0503adbdb716f750cf4a8215c7e2ef3b3dd5b2e5459958ed9ed.mp3">
    <source class="u-audio" type="audio/mpeg" src="https://media.martymcgui.re/b0/c8/a5/07/df8ed0503adbdb716f750cf4a8215c7e2ef3b3dd5b2e5459958ed9ed.mp3">
    <track label="English" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" src="https://media.martymcgui.re/bd/96/6f/4a/3421551b530208d7a037769342def51744a249ca3a4d70cffda5d479.vtt">
</video>
</p>
<p>How does it work? Well, browsers aren't actually too picky about the data types of the &lt;source&gt; elements inside. You can absolutely give them an audio source.</p>
<p>Add in a poster attribute to the &lt;video&gt; element, and you can give the appearance of a "real" video.</p>
<p>And finally, add in the &lt;source&gt; element with your subtitle track and you are good to go.</p>
<p>The relevant source for my example post looks something like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;video controls poster="poster.png" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width: 100%" src="audio.mp3"&gt;
  &lt;source class="u-audio" type="audio/mpeg" src="audio.mp3"&gt;
  &lt;track label="English" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" src="https://media.martymcgui.re/.../subtitles.vtt"&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
</pre>
<p>So, basically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use a &lt;video&gt; element
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Give it a poster attribute for a nice background</li>
  <li>Use an audio file for the &lt;source&gt; inside</li>
  <li>Use the &lt;track&gt; element for your captions/subtitles/etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>But is that the whole story? Sadly, no.</p>
<h2>Creating Subtitles/Captions in WebVTT Format</h2>
<p>In some ways, This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition is perfectly suited for automated captioning. In order to keep it short, I spend a good amount of time summarizing the newsletter into a <a href="https://media.martymcgui.re/7d/c2/ce/37/b46a74fb433e0faeced637a81545e3ba8b4706fbf0c65fef4ab5d51b.txt">concise script</a>, which I read almost verbatim. I typically end up including the transcript when I post the podcast, hidden inside a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details">&lt;details&gt;</a> element.</p>
<p>This script can be fed into gentle, along with the audio, to find all the alignments - but then I have a bunch of JSON data that is not particularly useful to the browser or even Facebook's player.</p>
<p>Thankfully, as I mentioned above, the BBC audiogram generator can output a Facebook-flavored SRT file, and that is pretty close.</p>
<p>After reading into the <a href="https://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/subtitles/webvtt.html">pretty expressive WebVTT spec</a>, playing with an <a href="https://github.com/silviapfeiffer/silviapfeiffer.github.io">SRT to WebVTT converter tool</a>, and finding an <a href="https://quuz.org/webvtt/">in-browser WebVTT validator</a>, I found a pretty quick way of converting those in my favorite text editor which basically boils down to changing something like this:</p>
<pre>
00:00:02,24 --&gt; 00:00:04,77
While at the 2017 IndieWeb Summit,

00:00:04,84 --&gt; 00:00:07,07
I sat down with some of the
participants to ask:
</pre>
<p>Into this:</p>
<pre>
WEBVTT

00:00:02.240 --&gt; 00:00:04.770
While at the 2017 IndieWeb Summit,

00:00:04.840 --&gt; 00:00:07.070
I sat down with some of the
  participants to ask:
</pre>
<p>Yep. When stripped down to the minimum, the only real differences in these formats is the time format. Decimals delimit subsecond time offsets (instead of commas), and three digits of precision instead of two. Ha!</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>If you've been following the podcast, you may have noticed that I have not started doing this for every episode.</p>
<p>The primary reason is that the BBC audiogram tool becomes verrrrry sluggish when working with a 10-minute long transcript. Editing the timings for my test post took the better part of an hour before I had an SRT file I was happy with. I <i>think</i> I could streamline the process by editing the existing text transcript into "caption-sized" chunks, and write a bit of code that will use the pre-chunked text file and the word-timings from gentle to directly create SRT and WebVTT files.</p>
<p>Additionally, I'd like to make these tools more widely available to other folks. My current workflow to get gentle's output into the BBC audiogram tool is an ugly hack, but I believe I could make it as "easy" as making sure that gentle is running in the background when you run the audiogram generator.</p>
<p>
  Beyond the technical aspects, I am excited about this as a way to add extra visual interest to, and potentially increase listener comprehension for, these short audio posts. There are folks doing lots of interesting things with audio, such as the folks at <a href="https://www.gretta.com/">Gretta</a>, who are doing "live transcripts" with a sort of dual navigation mode where you can click on a paragraph to jump the audio around and click on the audio timeline and the transcript highlights the right spot. <a href="https://www.gretta.com/1262100467/10010015/">Here's an example of what I mean</a>.
  <br />
</p>
<p>I don't know what I'll end up doing with this next, but I'm interested in feedback! Let me know what you think!</p>

<p>Baltimore's <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/09/25/172140/">first October 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on October 4th.</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Went to IndieWebCamp NYC last weekend! Had a really great time (that he really needs to write up). Figured out how to show closed captions / subtitles on audio content (and needs to write that up). Recently decided that Jekyll was slowing him down too much and decided to jump to Hugo. First steps there - use a sacrificial website to learn on that is much simpler, in this case the <a href="https://wehavetoask.com/">We Have to Ask Podcast</a>. Also showed off <a href="http://v6.robweychert.com/">Rob Weychert's</a> website as one that impressed him from IWC NYC due to the really nice typography, spacing, layout.</p>
<p><a href="https://djfalcon23.github.io/">djfalcon23.github.io</a> — Added a new slideshow feature. Can now show a model slideshow of past projects. In true HWC fashion, he pushed this feature live during the demo. Will be adding similar modal displays for PDF documents and videos.</p>
<p><a href="http://lizboren.art">lizboren.art</a> — Been changing her art portfolio site. It's hosted on <a href="http://artstation.com/">ArtStation</a> which has a pretty affordable "pro" level with good editing tools. She's been happy with it for now. Slightly more problematic is that her .art domain was registered on her behalf by her school and now she doesn't know how to get access to manage it. We tried to use the WHOIS info to track down who to contact at the controlling registrar.</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> — Been working on a site for work at Digital Harbor Foundation. They are relaunching blueprint.digitalharbor.org educator resource portal. They've been working on a clear structured landing page for people that are not registered for it, as well as cleaning up navigation for users who are registered. It's a WordPress site and they've been moving their content into "Sensei", a WordPress add-on for education content from WooCommerce.</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    We talked about doing design research and taking inspiration from sites that are similar to what you're working on.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Talked about the different approaches needed when working on content and structure versus working on making something attractive.</li>
  <li>Went around talking about pet peeves about the web: bad graphic design, not having an obvious login button, sites that use social logins (e.g. GitHub or Twitter) when they don't work, crucial interactions in modals that aren't clickable on mobile, surveillance and adware crap.</li>
  <li>Talked about the recent "alternative to ads" where the page runs a JavaScript bitcoin miner, and how wasteful this is in terms of energy vs. coins earned. Maybe all machines need mining ASICs? Talked about other alternatives like Brave and Flattr, compulsory licensing models and <a href="http://craphound.com/category/est/">Doctorow's Eastern Standard Tribe</a>, paywalls, paying for things with Bitcoin in general, money as an abstract concept.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to everybody who came out! We look forward to seeing you on <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-10-18-homebrew-website-club#Baltimore_MD">October 18th</a> at the Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center!</p>

    <div class="post e-content">
<p>Hey Folks in/near NYC! <a href="https://twitter.com/IndieWebCamp">@IndieWebCamp</a> NYC is just 5 days away, <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub> - <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub></p>

<p>Last year&rsquo;s IWC NYC was my first in-person IndieWeb experience, and I was completely caught up by the thoughtful people working first-hand to build a more personal, more social web; a web where your content, identity, and interactions are yours, instead of food for surveillance-powered ad-engines like Facebook.</p>

<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve started a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Baltimore">Homebrew Website Club in Baltimore</a>, a <a href="https://martymcgui.re/podcasts/indieweb/">weekly IndieWeb Podcast</a>, made <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Martymcgui.re">tons of improvements to my site</a>, and even created some IndieWeb tools, like a <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/spano">micropub media endpoint for storing photos, video, audio, and more</a>, a tool for <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/slater">posting events to your own site</a>, and a tool for <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/screech">posting audio, such as podcasts</a>.</p>

<p>So come on out for two days of participatory discussions, user experience design, and face-to-face help improving our personal websites and the future of the IndieWeb!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be recording interviews for the <a href="https://martymcgui.re/podcasts/indieweb/">This Week in the IndieWeb Podcast</a>, if you&rsquo;re interested in sharing your IndieWeb journey and thoughts.</p>

<p>There will also be some amazing people to meet, like IndieWeb co-founder <a href="http://tantek.com/">Tantek Çelik</a>, IndieWeb WordPress developer <a href="https://david.shanske.com/">David Shanske</a>, awesome designer <a href="http://hannahdonovan.com/">Hannah Donovan</a>, and many more!</p>

<p>Registration is super-affordable! Free if you have your own personal site! <a href="https://2017.indieweb.org/nyc">https://2017.indieweb.org/nyc</a>.</p>

<p>Hope to see you there!</p>

  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/08/25/001526/">Baltimore's second September 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on September 20th. It was our one-year anniversary, given that our first meeting occurred on <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2016/09/21/193105/">September 21st, 2016</a>.
  <br />
</p>
<p>We celebrated with cookies!</p>

<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – Set up bridgy on his new WordPress site since last time. Working on a post detailing his move from Hugo to WordPress. Hoping it serves as documentation to help with outreach to other folks who already use WordPress, or folks looking to start a new personal website. Also hoping the bridgy publish works, since this is his first time posting with it.</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://maryreisenwitz.com/">maryreisenwitz.com</a> – Working on web content for a DHF digital fabrication course that starts next week, starting with Autodesk Fusion 360. It's organized as "lessons" on a WordPress site at learn.digitalharbor.org.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://bouhmad.com/">bouhmad.com</a> – Prepping to launch his personal site at that URL. Has a local development version, written in Hugo. Will be posting about security research.</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://rhearamakrishnan.com/">rhearamakrishnan.com</a> – Working on her portfolio website, which mostly links to writing she has had published elsewhere. Wants to make sure all the outgoing links still work, update the look. Also has a lot of visual content like zines that she wants to display in an appealing way. Currently publishes via GitHub Pages, facing a learning curve making styling changes, but is sticking with it and wants to keep things simple.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – Super excited that we have had a year of HWC Baltimore meetups! Looking forward to more outreach in the year ahead, finding ways to reach people who don't yet know that they want to be part of the IndieWeb. On his personal site, been working on a per-month archive view. Playing both with Jekyll plugins to generate the pages and with learning CSS Grid to do the layout, because it's new and shiny. The slowness of Jekyll is really tempting him to jump to Hugo, despite knowing it will be a huge pain.</p>
<p>
  Shawn Grimes – Working on web content for a different DHF learning system called Blueprint. Currently focused on things like that rather than his personal website.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    We talked about some of the pros/cons of static site generators vs WordPress. E.g. security needs, ease of posting, etc. etc. etc...
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>We talked about Hugo being good for archiving content like old Evernote notes. You can make an archive that is more browsable/searchable than the Evernote exports and doesn't require Evernote.</li>
  <li>Talked about ways of taking and organizing notes, differing needs (e.g. need to write down something quickly, so a mobile interface is key). Some different options came up, like <a href="https://laverna.cc/">laverna.cc</a>, <a href="https://ulyssesapp.com/">ulyssesapp.com</a>.</li>
  <li>Talked about reasons not to store things on clouds like Evernote and Dropbox, targeted advertising. Tools to prevent surveillance such as <a href="https://better.fyi/">Better</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/focus/">Firefox Focus</a>.</li>
  <li>Talked about some general intro-to-IndieWeb stuff, how it got started, building blocks like POSSE and webmentions, and making progress through small incremental steps.</li>
</ul>

<p>We're very happy to have reached the milestone of a year of (nearly-) regular meetings! Thanks to everyone who has come out to be a part of these meetups so far.</p>
<p>
  We hope you'll join us again on for another HWC Baltimore meetup at Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center! Our next meetups will be <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-10-04-homebrew-website-club#Baltimore_MD">October 4th</a> followed by another on <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-10-18th-homebrew-website-club#Baltimore_MD">October 18th</a>.

  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/08/25/000915/">Baltimore's first September 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on September 6th. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="http://jonathanprozzi.net">jonathanprozzi.net</a> (Jonathan) – Stepped through Digital Ocean tutorials with nginx and has a fresh new WordPress site running for his personal site. Has a SemPress theme and the IndieWeb plugin and will be working through all those next. Happy to already have working rel-me stuff and being able to log into the IndieWeb wiki. Looking forward to helping others get set up as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://djfalcon23.github.io/">djfalcon23</a> (Derek) – Thinking about getting a ".is" domain. Likes the idea of using it with paths like ".is/cool", ".is/making". Started a new site for his light-up bicycling backpack, using his personal portfolio site as a template.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> (Marty) – Started a dedicated podcast-oriented page for <a href="https://martymcgui.re/podcasts/indieweb/">This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition</a>. Did some refactoring of his site to make it work reasonably. Next up is adding subscribe buttons for Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, and more. Did some research into other podcasts' website subscribe button designs.</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We also talked about Digital Ocean has a hosting provider. We like that they provide a lot of guides, in addition to being very affordable.</li>
  <li>
    Talked about geo-based TLDs as being more stable than ".ninja" and others. Reviewed some podcast subscribe button designs on a few sites.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Talked about recent video games and 8-bit aesthetics.</li>
</ul>

  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/08/07/114608/">Baltimore's second August 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on August 23rd. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p>
  jonathanprozzi.net (Jonathan) – Had been working on a wedding site with Hugo and making progress. Got really frustrated with adding image galleries, which required a lot of extra tools. Realized that he could accomplish the same thing in WordPress really quickly. So, spent quiet writing hour starting over in WordPress. At this point, just wants to have it done, rather than spending time learning something new along the way.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  martymcgui.re (Marty) – Since last time has been thinking a lot more about delivering transcriptions with audio content. Did more experimenting with Audiogram, and found the <a href="https://github.com/BBC-News-Labs/audiogram">BBC's fork</a>, which supports subtitles and transcription editing, but also depends on a lot of private BBC infrastructure out of the box. Is now able to get timestamped transcripts by combining an audio file and long-form text transcription using a tool called <a href="https://github.com/lowerquality/gentle/">gentle</a>. Then by feeding that into a hacked-up copy of the BBC's Audiogram can generate video with hardcoded subtitles. Here's an <a href="https://media.martymcgui.re/10/ef/8f/99/b181f11e199c00112d921955fd2bf5d78254ea0a9fef2a118aa37c30.mp4">example from the most recent This Week in the IndieWeb</a>. Pretty neat! Also experimenting with providing a text transcript of the audio newsletter along w/ the audio via a simple HTML details/summary elements with an iframe. <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/08/19/140447/">Example here</a>.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We talked about use cases where static sites are great (simple project sites) and not-so-great (lots of media files).</li>
  <li>We also chatted a lot about the future of the This Week in the IndieWeb audio edition, making the content more accessible, making it more engaging.</li>
  <li>
    We also talked about being aware of when it makes sense to use manual tools vs. trying to creating automation, such as the tradeoffs with using "manual" video editing tools vs. tools like Audiogram.
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>

<p>One of the most powerful ideas discussed is the &ldquo;algorithm that works for you&rdquo;, to avoid information overwhelm.</p>

  <h1 class="post-title p-name"><a href="/2017/08/10/syndicating-audio-posts-with-wnycs-audiogram-generator/">Syndicating Audio Posts with WNYC&#39;s Audiogram Generator</a></h1>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  
  
    
    <div class="post e-content">
<p>I publish a <a href="https://martymcgui.re/tag/this-week-indieweb-podcast/">few</a> <a href="https://wehavetoask.com/">different</a> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bigimprov">podcasts</a> and often find myself advertising new episodes by syndicating new posts to various social media silos.</p>
<p>Sadly, few social media services consider audio to be "a thing", despite often having robust support for video.</p>
<p>I'm certainly not the first person to notice this, and the fine folks at <a href="https://medium.com/@WNYC/socialaudio-e648e8a5f2e9">WNYC have taken this audio sharing problem head-on</a>.</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="https://github.com/nypublicradio/audiogram/">Audiogram Generator</a>, an open source project that runs on NodeJS and uses FFMPEG to take samples from your audio files and munge them into short videos for sharing on social networks.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://media.martymcgui.re/c9/a5/74/e2/55643f40672e93224a89569f92db05c4d3fda4e466caa962d2c26551.png" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of how I got the Audiogram Generator running on my macOS laptop using Docker.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, so first I installed docker and docker-machine and created a new default machine:</p>
<pre>
  brew install docker docker-machine
  docker-machine create -d virtualbox default
</pre>
<p>Once that finished, I set my environment variables so the docker command line utility can talk to this machine:</p>
<pre>eval $(docker-machine env)</pre>
<p>Next, it was time to download the source for the audiogram generator from GitHub and build the Docker container for it:</p>
<pre>
  git clone https://github.com/nypublicradio/audiogram.git
  cd audiogram
  docker build -t audiogram .
</pre>
<p>Finally, I could run it:</p>
<pre>
  docker run -p 8888:8888 -t -i audiogram
  npm start
</pre>
<p>Once up, I pointed my browser at <a href="http://192.168.99.100:8888/">http://192.168.99.100:8888/</a> and I saw pretty much the interface that you see in the screenshot above.</p>
<p>The basic usage steps are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose an audio file</li>
  <li>
    Choose a template
    <ul>
      <li>Templates w/ images are hardcoded into the app, so if you want to use them with your own images you'll have to make changes to the source.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Choose a selection of the audio that is less than 300 seconds long</li>
  <li>Add any text if the template requires it</li>
  <li>Generate!</li>
  <li>Download</li>
  <li>Upload to silos!</li>
</ul>
<p>I made a <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/08/09/190935/">sample post to my own site using a selection of an interview</a> and then syndicated that post by uploading the same video to <a href="https://twitter.com/schmarty/status/895423872115146754">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marty.mcguire.54/videos/vb.1292103610/10210046638744486/">Facebook</a>, <s>and Mastodon</s>.</p>
<p>I don't yet know exactly how I'll choose what portions to share on each silo, what text and links to accompany them to encourage folks to listen to the full episodes, and so on. There are also some quirks to learn. For example, Twitter <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20172128?lang=en#video-formats">has a maximum length of 2:20 for videos</a>, and its cropping tool would glitch out and reset to defaults unless I stopped it "near" the end.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a very detailed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1US1llZexMtJi0uIYT_GKShFlD2nRjRmZuVB024zOjSo/edit#">Audiogram Generator usage doc</a> with lots of examples and guidelines for making attention-getting posts.</p>
<p>For the near term I want to play with the tool to see what kinds of results I can make. Long-term I think this would be a really neat addition to my <a href="https://indieweb.org/Screech">Screech</a> tool, which is designed for posting audio to your own website.</p>
<p>How do you feel about audiograms? I'd love to hear other folks' thoughts!</p>

  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/08/07/113251/">Baltimore's first August 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on August 9th.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p>
  djfalcon23 (Derek) – been on break of web dev to learn Android dev. Set up a schedule to work on his portfolio site on Wednesdays. Has a WIP site up at <a href="https://djfalcon23.github.io/">djfalcon23.github.io</a> with a landing page. Next steps are modals to display the content for the main sections, a carousel for other photos. After that, it's time to make a project page for his LED backpack with brake and turn signals for cyclists.
  <br />
</p>
<p>jonathanprozzi.net (Jonathan) – started a new Hugo project for his wedding which will be his "Hugo project" so he can feel free to move his main site over to WordPress. Bought and set up a new domain and a new Hugo project for that.</p>
<p>polarfire.net (Isaac) – In town visiting Marty. Spent quiet writing hour tracking down the source for his Pelican-based site which was last updated 2014 and getting the dependencies installed. Likes starting side projects, so might port it to Hugo. Many of his projects are related to owning his data on a home server. Next major step there is setting up backups w/ duplicity.</p>
<p>martymcgui.re (Marty) – Did some reading from the folks at <a href="https://twitter.com/meetgretta">@meetgretta</a> (formerly signl.fm) and learned about a tool called <a href="https://github.com/nypublicradio/audiogram/">Audiogram from WNYC</a>. It generates videos from audio files for sharing on silos that have good video sharing support but not audio, which is most of them. Made an <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/08/07/113251/">example post with an interview with Ben Werdmüller from the This Week in the IndieWeb Podcast</a> that is syndicated to <a href="https://twitter.com/schmarty/status/895423872115146754">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marty.mcguire.54/videos/vb.1292103610/10210046638744486/">Facebook</a>, <s>and Mastodon</s>.</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    djfalcon23 showed a cool use of parallax on <a href="http://www.firewatchgame.com/">firewatchgame.com</a>.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Talked about automated captions for audio, showed off some of the <a href="https://medium.com/matter-driven-narrative/signl-fm-on-making-a-social-media-interface-for-podcasts-9e1d16667f1">Gretta demos</a>.</li>
  <li> djfalcon23 pointed us to <a href="https://twitter.com/noopkat">@noopkat</a>, who streams live development and was recently working on similar tools.</li>
  <li>martymcgui.re did a quick demo of the micro.blog iOS app for posting tonight's photo</li>
</ul>

  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/07/13/123031/">Baltimore's second July 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on July 26th. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="http://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – After setting up a local WordPress dev site last time, revisited his existing Hugo site. The Hugo documentation has received an update, so he walked through making a new site from scratch, found out the theme configuration for his old site was not working as Hugo docs suggest. Wants to make sure his Hugo experience isn't colored by a misunderstanding on his part. Feels stuck between wanting to improve his existing stack and workflow vs spending the time to convert everything to WordPress.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – Inspired by IndieWeb Summit session on Events, made a couple of improvements to event posts on his site. First added a "subscribe to calendar" link to his front page and "Add to Calendar" links on his individual event pages so folks can get calendar reminders of his indie events. Second, added a webmention submit form ("did you mention this? post the URL here") to all his posts, which should make it easier to send indie RSVPs to his indie events. Set up a new iPod Touch with the micro.blog iOS client and has used it to post a couple of photos to his site without much trouble and a nice (if somewhat quirky) workflow. Has been changing up some of the microformats markup on his posts to try and make them work well with both Woodwind and Atom feeds generated by Granary.</p>
<p>We talked about a writing app called <a href="https://ulyssesapp.com/">Ulysses</a>, which Jonathan has been using for work and finds the writing is a faster process than his previous workflow with Markdown. Also talked sunk cost of working with the tools we already have working vs spending the time to set up and learn something new that might (eventually) be better. A tempting goal is to moving from posting to our personal sites and enjoying IndieWeb benefits for ourselves to making ourselves into ambassadors for folks in Gen2/3 by adopting WordPress + plugins.</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/06/28/212819/">Baltimore's first July 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on July 12th.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="http://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> - finished up a post from the last HWC meetup about his thoughts on switching from Hugo to Wordpress. Had it all written, but forgot to publish it - largely because of the multistep Hugo publishing process! Says this illustrates that the process overhead of using the tool is clearly getting in the way. Started a local Wordpress install to get things going. Before switching - wants to figure out how to preserve the Hugo version of his site as a snapshot (maybe on a subdomain?). Cares about both the content and the presentation of it. Also wants to figure out another project to encourage him to learn Hugo.</p>
<p>Darius - started in on a portfolio-style site on Wordpress. Has a theme he likes but is struggling with customizing it due to its documentation. Thinking about what he wants to put on the site. Also found out that a Wordpress site that he manages for work was hacked by spammers, so worked on fixing that.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> - since last time, cleaned up microformats around his likes, reposts, bookmarks to add explicit p-name and e-content, so readers like Woodwind will show something more reasonable than the "implied" names. Hasn't been working much on his site, so spent some time on his <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Martymcgui.re">IndieWeb wiki user page</a> to read through and re-organize his itches to choose something to work on. Inspired by the <a href="https://indieweb.org/2017/events">2017 IndieWebSummit session on events</a>, started work on a Jekyll generator plugin that will create iCal .ics files for his event posts, so he can put "add to calendar" buttons on his indie events.</p>
<p>We chatted about the Battle for the Net, Wordpress security, <a href="https://indieweb.org/WordPress_Outreach_Club">Wordpress Outreach Club</a>, intricacies of how the various IndieWeb Wordpress plugins and theming operates, and more!</p>

  We hope that you'll join us for the next HWC Baltimore, which will meet on <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-07-26-homebrew-website-club">July 26th</a> at the Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center!

<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/06/06/135528/">Baltimore's June 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on June 28th.</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> - Been very busy with work. Wrote a couple of posts since the last meeting. Tonight started a reflective post about his decision to use Hugo for his site vs Wordpress, which he already uses a lot for work. Feels like he has learned a little bit of Go (which Hugo is written in), but mostly has just learned Hugo and felt that's held him back. Interested in the Wordpress API and maybe move his site over because he wants to post more and still learn.</p>
<p><a href="https://eddiehinkle.com/">eddiehinkle.com</a> - Been working on his site rewrite in Angular Universal. Today worked on micropub media endpoint. Is saving files successfully, now needs to add file extensions and return the Location URL. Also been working on <a href="https://indieweb.org/Indigenous">Indigenous</a>, his iOS micropub client. Been switching back and forth between the two as he makes progress or gets stuck on one or the other. Other stuff since last time: adding OwnYourSwarm, OwnYourGram. Having a micropub client on his phone has enabled him to send lots and lots of likes - enough that he decided to move likes out of his main social stream page and treat them as a reply.</p>
<p>djfalcon23 (domains currently expired) - been learning web development on and off for the last year. Now building a portfolio site using Bootstrap and trying out React, but it is a lot. Also trying to (re-)learn Android development.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> - Went to IndieWeb Summit and it was amazing! Added checkins to his site w/ OwnYourSwarm while there because of jealousy of seeing other folks checking in with Swarm. Really attracted to the gamification, but wants to make a checkin client so he doesn't have to give them his data. Also been cleaning up microformats on his site so that reply contexts on other site and in readers like Woodwind look better.</p>
<p>Chatted a bit about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Double-dipping" - choosing side projects that involve technology you already need to use (or learn) for work</li>
  <li>Angular Universal, basically a server-side render of Angular which includes a static rendering of markup as well as all the scripts and data to "hydrate" the page</li>
  <li>
    Saving posts on Facebook and trying to PESOS to a bookmark post, but the Facebook API seems to have those locked down.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Learning React is pretty overwhelming, lots of tooling and stuff up front that doesn't feel connected to a project.</li>
  <li>Guided learning w/ online systems with guided courses like Pluralsight have been really helpful for Jonathan.</li>
  <li>Gamification of Foursquare - coins for photos and random things, comparison with friends, weekly generated summaries with titles like "Weekend Getaways"</li>
  <li>Talked about how some aspects of the "design language" of web sites have converged and solidified several years ago. djfalcon23 likes looking at the designs on the <a href="http://instagram.com/welovewebdesign">welovewebdesign Instagram page</a>. Wants to see more like that in the world.</li>
  <li>Talked about IndieWeb Summit and the videos available, particularly the Wordpress sessions.</li>
  <li>
    Spent a lot of time on the <a href="https://indieweb.org/2017/perweb">Personal Web Sites examples</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Awesome suggestion by djfalcon23 to bring an inspirational website to the next meetings.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Also really loved the discussions about <a href="https://indieweb.org/2017/specialmicropub">special micropub clients</a>, <a href="https://indieweb.org/2017/events">events</a>, <a href="https://indieweb.org/2017/refresh">updating the IndieWeb site to be less dev-heavy</a>, and especially the lovely <a href="https://indieweb.org/2017/perweb">tour of interesting personal pages on the web</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/05/12/172008/">Baltimore's second May 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on May 31st.</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net">jonathanprozzi.net</a> - Since last time, did some cosmetic updates to site. Also did a lot of traveling. Catching up now on finishing a series of posts he started at <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/05/10/202154/">last HWC (May 10th)</a>. Now one-and-a-half posts behind his schedule. Wants to stick with consistency of writing something once per week.</p>
<p><a href="https://amyhurst.com/">amyhurst.com</a> - Working on a website for work (something that is usually on her "some day" list). Gathering student questions from emails into an FAQ on a Wordpress site.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re">martymcgui.re</a> - Added JSON Feed to blog.adafruit.com because it was easy and why not? Also talked about webmention notifications in his home Matrix chat server via Hubot. Is interested in more textual/conversational interfaces for things in his life and fewer apps and pages to remember to look at.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metamage.com/">metamage.com</a> (<a href="https://jjuran.org/">jjuran.org</a>) - All sites now HTTPS. A couple are HTTP/HTTPS for classic MacOS clients, others are HTTPS-only. Used PNG/GIF and CSS to make a screenshot of an emulator animate when moused-over (bottom of <a href="https://www.v68k.org/advanced-mac-substitute/">https://www.v68k.org/advanced-mac-substitute/</a>). Some fun browser issues w/ image handling (dithering?) in Safari. His site uses a homebrew Perl static site generator, shared CSS across all his sites. Planning to rework it in the V language.</p>
<p>Chatted about Micropub becoming a W3C Recommendation, including going through <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2017/05/30/1/w3c-micropub">Aaron Parecki's announcement post</a>, which is a very clear walk through of the development process. Talked about <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> as an up-and-coming social platform that supports Micropub out of the box. Talked about the power of social nudges (like "how's that project going?") for making progress on projects. Two of us (jjuran and martymcgui.re) will be at <a href="https://2017.indieweb.org">IndieWeb Summit</a> in Portland later this June and are looking forward to it!</p>

  <h1 class="post-title p-name"><a href="/2017/05/26/site-updates-webmention-notifications-in-matrix-with-hubot/">Site Updates: Webmention Notifications in Matrix with Hubot</a></h1>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  
  
    
    <div class="post e-content">
<p>
  <i><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">Jonathan Prozzi</a> and I have challenged one another to make a post about improving our websites once a week. This is me getting back on the train!</i>
  <br />
</p>
<p>In a previous site update I wrote about setting up a <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/03/29/161441/">system to notify me</a> whenever my site received <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/">webmentions</a>. Essentially, this meant that I could now get notifications on my phone and desktop whenever somebody interacted with my site, such as: replying to one of my posts on their own site, retweeting or favoriting one of my posts, or even RSVPs to my Facebook events.</p>
<p>One thing I didn't super like about this system is that it used the Pushbullet service which, while great, is not under my control.</p>
<p>I've been running a <a href="http://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> chat server at home for a while now. I primarily use it to chat with people in my household in IRC channels. I use a really nice client for Matrix called <a href="https://about.riot.im/">Riot</a>, which runs in the browser, but is also available on Android and iOS, and is capable of sending notifications about chat events, which I have found really handy.</p>
<p>Recently, I've added a chatbot to my Matrix server named <a href="https://hubot.github.com/">Hubot</a>, thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/davidar/hubot-matrix/">Hubot-Matrix adapter</a>. Hubot is super neat because it is fairly <a href="https://hubot.github.com/docs/scripting/">easy to script up new behaviors</a>, and it has nice built-in support for the web - both for making web requests, but Hubot also runs a server for <i>accepting web requests</i>. Once I realized this, it occurred to me that I could replace my previous notification system that uses Pushbullet with one that goes through Hubot.</p>
<p>First, a note on security. Exposing a chatbot's HTTP listener interface to the great wide internet comes at some risk! I made sure to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I run Hubot behind a firewall, so no plain HTTP traffic can come directly across the internet.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Using another home server, I set up nginx to act as a secure HTTPS proxy, using a certificate from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> to encrypt all traffic that goes over the internet.</li>
  <li>I decided that any behaviors I write for Hubot that use the HTTP listener will use some kind of secret token to ensure that the request is valid. I don't want spammers blowing up my chatrooms!</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided that the bot should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Allow a user to request webmention.io notifications for a given site into any room.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Generate and store a "callback secret" to work with webmention.io's Web Hook system and tell the user the URL and callback secret to configure over on the <a href="https://webmention.io/dashboard">Webmention.io Dashboard</a>.</li>
  <li>Accept HTTP requests from webmention.io at something like &lt;HUBOT_HOST&gt;/hubot/wmio/notify</li>
  <li>Verify that the request contains the callback secret</li>
  <li>Generate a nice text summary of the notification based on its contents</li>
  <li>Send the notification to the room that the user was in when they made the follow request.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  With that in mind, I began learning lots about <a href="https://hubot.github.com/docs/scripting/#testing-hubot-scripts">testing</a> <a href="https://amussey.github.io/2015/08/11/testing-hubot-scripts.html">Hubot scripts</a>, refreshing myself on <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">Coffeescript</a>, and so on.
  <br />
</p>
<p>I am now happy to introduce this first (janky) release of my Hubot Script, <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/hubot-webmentionio-notify">hubot-webmentionio-notify</a>!</p>
<p>Once installed, you can start a conversation with your hubot and ask it to follow a site:</p>
<pre>
  you&gt; hubot wmio follow mycoolsite.biz
  <br />
  hubot&gt; @you OK! Use this as your Web Hook: &lt;HUBOT_URL&gt;/hubot/wmio/notify
And use this as your callback secret: 1a2b3c4d5e6f7890000
</pre>
<p>The string "mycoolsite.biz" can actually be anything and should be something easy to remember in case you want to unfollow notifications later. Hubot doesn't check incoming mentions against it at the moment.</p>
<p>You can enter the URL and callback secret in the Webmention.io dashboard, and future webmentions will be sent to your Hubot and output into the room of your choice.</p>

  <figcaption>Notification example - a user on Twitter mentioned my Twitter handle in a post there.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I don't know how useful <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/hubot-webmentionio-notify">hubot-webmentionio-notify</a> will be for other folks at the moment, but I am excited be getting these notifications via services that I control. I look forward to building more fun things with Hubot!</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/04/21/142337/">Baltimore's April 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on April 19th. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p>jonathanprozzi.net - not been making his weekly posts in challenges with Marty. Inspired by a nearby bookstore closing, realized he had done lots of learning in bookstores over the last ~15 years. New idea for a series of posts cataloging all the things learned in a specific place over the years. Wants to journal the things he is learning on a weekly(ish) basis to build an archive.</p>
<p>brianey.com - been writing up lots of ideas for his blog but not finishing them. Based on that unfinished work, started writing about some new topics on creativity. For example, writing about starting things vs. achieving them. Looking forward to writing those including cute graphics of badgers, (em)barkers, etc. and being inspired by those posts to take on other unfinished posts.</p>
<p>amyhurst.com - working on an FAQ page for all the questions she gets from students seeking to get into the grad programs that she manages. It should be a useful resource for students, but also for her to copy and paste into emails from students who don't or won't read it.</p>
<p>martymcgui.re - brought a bunch of posts from an old blog into his site, including old comments from disqus. Did updates to site plumbing so he can add syndication to his posts after the fact with micropub updates, allowing him to get webmentions and notifications of interactions on Twitter, FB, etc via brid.gy without pulling out a laptop.</p>
<p>We talked about the upcoming <a href="https://2017.indieweb.org/">2017 IndieWeb Summit June 24th-25th in Portland, Oregon</a> and discussed the indie RSVPs on the site. From there we ended up on <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">Aaron Parecki</a>'s site and chatted about the amount of information that is collected and shared, what things we'd like to be collecting for review about ourselves, what things we're comfortable publishing.</p>

  <h1 class="post-title p-name"><a href="/2017/05/08/site-updates-easier-posse-with-micropub-edits/">Site-Updates: Easier POSSE with Micropub Edits!</a></h1>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  
  
    
    <div class="post e-content">
<p>
  <i><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">Jonathan Prozzi</a> and I have challenged one another to make a post about improving our websites once a week. This one should have gone up last week!</i>
  <br />
</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I posted some thoughts about <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Martymcgui.re#My_IndieWeb_Setup">my IndieWeb setup</a> called "<a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/04/19/151612/">Easier POSSE with Micropub Edits?</a>" in which I wished for a tool that would let me take a given post from my site, syndicate it to silos like Twitter and Facebook (tweaking the content if I want), and updating the post on my site to show the links to those syndicated copies.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I failed to make at least one important thing clear in my original post – why do I care about syndication links? There are many reasons.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I have set up a <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/03/29/161441/">system to notify me when my posts get webmentions from other sites</a>.</li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://brid.gy/">Brid.gy</a> will <a href="https://indieweb.org/backfeed">backfeed</a> comments and reactions from sites like Twitter and Facebook to my site via webmention, but <a href="https://brid.gy/about#link">only if brid.gy knows which posts on those silos correspond to a post on my site</a>.
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If I decide that a post should be syndicated to a silo, it's because I want it to reach the people who follow me there and, if that is true, I also want their interactions to come back to my site. So, in these ways, a post isn't "done" unless it is on my site, with syndicated copies on the silos I care about, and with syndication links for brid.gy to feed the interactions back.</p>
<h3>Starting at the End</h3>
<p>I decided to start by making my site's Micropub server support <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#source-content">Micropub Source Content Queries</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#update">Micropub Updates</a>. Any tool that helped automate syndication would need this plumbing to operate.</p>
<p>When implementing a new feature, it always helps to have something to test against. So, I went looking for a Micropub <b>client</b> which supported queries and edits. The test suite for Micropub at micropub.rocks includes a lovely <a href="https://micropub.rocks/implementation-reports/clients/">implementation report grid</a>, showing which Micropub clients support what features of the spec.</p>
<p>Of the clients listed, two of them were web-based and Open Source. I had played with and liked <a href="https://inklings.io/inkstone/">Inkstone</a> in the past, but its edit features are currently considered a work-in-progress. So, I tried out <a href="https://micropublish.net/">Micropublish.net</a>, and it was exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Micropublish has a feature to let you enter a URL for a post on your site to edit. It will use Micropub source content queries to get the source data for that post and let you edit the content and other properties of the post. It can then send a Micropub update to save the updated version of the post back to your site, if your server supports updates. It even has a great feature for developers - a "Preview" button will show you exactly what request will be sent to your server for the update.</p>

</figure>
<p>Micropublish.net is a great tool for testing out Micropub query and update support, but my Micropub server is bespoke, hastily-written, hand-rolled Python. So, while it was easy enough to add query support, it took me a while to get my code structure cleaned up, write some tests, and actually implement updates.</p>
<h3>A New Workflow</h3>
<p>I am pleased to say that it works and, with the help of Micropublish.net, I now have a functioning workflow for publishing to my site and syndicating to silos like Twitter and Facebook, even from my phone, without having to open my laptop, edit YAML data, and push git repositories around. It looks like this.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Make a new post to my site with a micropub client like <a href="https://quill.p3k.io/">Quill</a>.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Open the post for editing in micropublish.net (I use Url Forwarder for Android to make this super easy on my phone, a bookmarklet makes it easy on my laptop).</li>
  <li>
    In a new tab, log in to Twitter and make a similar post, copy the URL to the new tweet into the Syndication field on my post.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Repeat the steps to make posts on Facebook, Mastodon, etc., copying their URLs into the Syndication field.</li>
  <li>
    Finally, hit "Update" in micropublish.net to update my post with the syndication links.
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>

  <figcaption>Screenshot of micropublish.net with new syndication links</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is still a very manual process, but it now makes it <b>possible</b> to <b>finish</b> a post in a way that I couldn't before. In the spirit of <a href="https://indieweb.org/manual_until_it_hurts">manual until it hurts</a>, I will use this for a while and see what existing pain points remain, and what new ones appear, to help decide what comes next.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://barryfrost.com/">Barry Frost</a> for micropublish.net and to <a href="http://tantek.com/">Tantek</a> for the nudge to write an update!</p>

  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/03/29/145427/">Baltimore's April 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on April 19th.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p>brianey.com – Been working on some content based on personal notes, which he takes all the time, about things like stuff he's read, etc. Thought about turning ~5 of his notes at a time into monthly lists, but has been writing a lot. Might be more like each note becomes a paragraph-long post. He also manages a newsletter that usually covers one topic, but might automate these new "listy" posts into a collection for the newsletter.</p>
<p>jonathanprozzi.net – Been working on a longer content post, part two of a series that started in March about creativity and code and his personal learning journey. Wants to keep up with post-a-week challenge. Started capturing ideas because he tends to forget topics if he doesn't get started on them. Doesn't want to have long spans of time between posts, so needs a system to keep track of posting as he gets too busy to take big chunks of time.</p>
<p>martymcgui.re – Been working on cleaning up cruft in his site implementation, not a lot of publicly visible stuff. Also been thinking a lot about things that stop him from posting, like not being able to easily syndicate posts while on mobile, and thinking of plans to make it easier. Tonight worked on the first part of supporting micropub edits for his site by working on source queries.</p>
<p>We also had a good discussion about how folks track their projects, keep ongoing notes, nudge themselves to make progress, and more. We talked about tools like Google Calendar and Tasks, laverna.cc, "GTD", and more that I forgot to write down.</p>

  We hope that you'll join us for the next HWC Baltimore on May 10th back here at the Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center! It's an "Off-Week" for the usual HWC schedule. After that we're back on track with another "On-Week" HWC on May 31st!

    <div class="post e-content">
<p><i>Update: thanks to Ryan Barrett for pointing me to his <a href="https://snarfed.org/2015-11-29_keep-bridgy-publish-dumb">Keep Bridgy Publish dumb</a> post, which explains why Bridgy doesn't include the features mentioned below!</i></p>

<p><i>Nerd alert: This post is me geeking out and will involve talk of protocols.</i></p>

<p>In keeping with the IndieWeb concept of <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> (Publishing on my Own Site, Syndicating Elsewhere), I try to make social media posts on my own site first and then make similar (not always identical!) posts to my accounts on silos like Twitter and Facebook. I then add links to the posts on my site indicating that you can find the "syndicated copies" of that post on those silos.</p>
<p>My process for doing this is something like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Make a new post, likely with a micropub client like <a href="https://quill.p3k.io/">Quill</a>.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Log in to Twitter and make a similar post, making note of the URL to the new tweet.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Log in to Facebook and make a similar post, making note of the URL to the new FB post.</li>
  <li>Edit the metadata to my post to indicate the new syndication links.</li>
  <li>Re-publish the post on my site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the way my site is set up, this manual process requires the use of my laptop, so I can't do it on the go.</p>
<p>When thinking of ways to automate this process, I found myself drawn to another nice IndieWeb tool called <a href="https://telegraph.p3k.io/">Telegraph</a>. Telegraph takes the URL for a post, finds links inside that post, and (if they support <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/">webmentions</a>) allows me to notify those sites about that my post links to theirs with a single click.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://media.martymcgui.re/6d/66/67/1d/8e692206218c78c4606910c526df4c4ca3136cae2bd79059208291ef.png" alt="" />
  <figcaption>Excerpt from Telegraph's UI with buttons to Send Webmention to supported URLs</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I like the way Telegraph works for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    It's not purpose-built for a single website - it can be used for sending webmentions from any site that publishes their content with the right markup to any site that can receive them.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>It puts the final decision to send a mention in my hands - I can choose to send mentions to any particular link mentioned in my post, or not.</li>
  <li>With a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a>, the process of sending webmentions becomes very simple. I visit the page for my post, click my Telegraph bookmark in my browser, and Telegraph shows me the links and send buttons for my post.</li>
</ul>
<p>There already exists a great tool for copying content from my site to certain silos: <a href="https://brid.gy/">brid.gy</a>. While brid.gy's primary use case is to use webmentions to syndicate comments and other activity from silos onto your own site, brid.gy also has a <a href="https://brid.gy/about#publishing">Publish</a> feature which accepts a URL from your site and attempts to create a similar post on the silo of your choice. Brid.gy Publish is a great feature, and I make good use of it. However, there are still a few pain points that I feel when using it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    While Brid.gy Publish gives a nice preview of what it will do, I can't tweak the content before publishing without editing my own post.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Brid.gy does not, as far as I can tell, support bookmarklet functionality. So, publishing takes multiple steps: <ol>
  <li>Visit my brid.gy profile page for a particular silo account.</li>
  <li>Enter the URL for the post on my site.</li>
  <li>Approve the post.</li>
  <li>Copy the URL for the new silo post from brid.gy.<ul>
  <li><strong>Note:</strong> These steps <i>can</i> be <a href="https://brid.gy/about#webmentions">automated via hidden links and webmentions</a>, and it even <a href="https://brid.gy/about#response">returns the URL for the new post</a>. However, this comes at the cost of the ability to preview what is to be posted.</li></ul></li></ol></li>
  <li>Finally, while Brid.gy lets me know in its UI that my post succeeded, Brid.gy has no mechanism for informing my site that the new syndicated post is available. I still need to enter the syndication URLs into my post manually and re-publish my post.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that groundwork of existing tools, here is what (I think) my ideal workflow would look like:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Make a new post to my site, likely with a micropub client like Quill.
  </li>
  <li>While looking at my post, click a bookmarklet that takes me to a syndication tool.</li>
  <li>The syndication tool shows me previews of what my post would look like on each silo where I'd like to publish. I can tweak the content, if needed.</li>
  <li>A single "Publish" click for each silo would create the post on that silo, but would <i>also</i> update my website with the new syndication link.</li>
</ol>
<p>This tool seems non-trivial to implement, but I think there are several building blocks which could be quite useful:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/kylewm/silo.pub">silo.pub</a> is a micropub-to-multiple-silos service that can simplify the process of getting content into silos. Brid.gy Publish also does much of this.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/">Micropub</a> supports <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#source-content">querying source properties of a given post</a>. (it also supports <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#syndication-targets">querying for a list of syndication targets</a>, but this seems primarily intended for setups where the micropub server itself will handle the syndication).</li>
  <li>Micropub supports <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#update">updates</a>. this could be used to add the syndication targets back to the original post. In fact, this <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#add">use case is in the spec</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not currently aware of anyone who does POSSE with this particular flow. I would be interested to know other folks' thoughts on this! Feel free to let me know with a post on your own site that mentions this one, or hit me up in the <a href="https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/">#indieweb-dev IRC chat</a>!</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">Jonathan Prozzi</a> and I have challenged one another to make a post about improving our websites once a week. I'm late with this one!
  <br />
</p>
<p>Most of the features on my website are experiments in learning new things. Sometimes I learn a better way of doing something that I've already built into the site and it's time to migrate!</p>
<h2>Moving Media files from Git LFS to a Media Endpoint</h2>
<p>I build my site with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and I store my site's configuration and text content via <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. One of the things that most folks avoid with Git is storing text content (which fits into Git's model of efficiently storing differences over time) with large binary files like images, etc. (which Git cannot manage as efficiently).</p>
<p>When I first set up my site, I made use of <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">Git LFS</a> ("Large File Storage") for managing anything that wasn't text. Any images, video, or audio that I added to my site was stored in an _assets/ folder in a way that matched uploaded files to the posts they were a part of. Git LFS would transparently ship those files off to a secondary server rather than include their content in the Git repository itself. I had to go through some hoops to set up my local <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> server to support Git LFS and to set up Git LFS with the server that handles receiving new posts via <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/">Micropub</a>, compiling and deploying the site.</p>
<p>
  It turns out that there are many reasons that a site would want to handle media files separately from the text content that refers to them. In fact, it is a common enough pattern that the Micropub standard includes a definition for a separate "<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#media-endpoint">media endpoint</a>" to handle file uploads. I shared a Micropub media endpoint implementation that I built called <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/01/26/122700/">Spano</a> a while back, and it has been working well with support from tools like <a href="https://quill.p3k.io/">Quill</a>. So the text content of my site is served from https://martymcgui.re/, and my media files from https://media.martymcgui.re/. With a couple of changes in my code and my workflows, this has become the way I handle all media files for my site.
  <br />
</p>
<p>However, I still had a bunch of files in site being handled by Git LFS, and some of my Jekyll code (plugins and templates) for showing embeds expected files to be on the local filesystem. This past week I took some time to write some scripts to find all references to those local files, migrate them to my media server, and update the outgoing links. I also updated my embed handling so it didn't rely on local files. This let me delete a lot of local metadata I was keeping but not using, like all the EXIF tags in uploaded photos. I am now Git LFS free and it feels like one less thing to worry about.</p>
<h2>Better Caching for Mentions from Webmention.io</h2>
<p>When I finally started <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/03/22/003710/">displaying webmentions</a>, I had a very simple model for how to cache all the info from webmention.io. Basically: I stored all mentions in a big array and, when my site went to fetch new mentions, it would keep fetching until it saw the "last" mention again. This led to a bit of a bug where someone might send me a mention, update their page, and send the mention again. My site would not be able to recognize the "last" mention, so it would fetch all my mentions again, leading to everything appearing twice.</p>
<p>This past week I rewrote my mention handling to avoid this problem by replacing this array and storing mentions in a hash based on the source and target. The new code also checks to see if the verification date of the mention has changed (giving me a way to detect and notify about changed mentions in the future). I also reorganized my mention cache to include an index by the target URL on my site. This makes it a bit quicker to find mentions for a given page when rendering out the site.</p>
<p>Neither of these changes are really visible to readers of my site, but they have been useful for cleaning things up. The webmention.io handling in particular has brought my plugin a lot closer to being something I could release for other people to use!</p>

    <div class="post e-content">
<p>Inspired by <a href="http://eddiehinkle.com/article/2017/03/viewing-webmentions.html">Eddie Hinkle's recent post about viewing webmentions</a>, I decided to improve the way I display webmentions on my site.</p>
<p>TL;DR, my site now pulls attempts to recognize single-emoji comments and display them as a "Reaction".</p>
<p>Slightly longer version - my site uses <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmention.io</a> for handling webmentions, and I use <a>brid.gy</a> to backfeed interactions from Facebook to my own site. The way brid.gy handles Facebook reactions other than the standard "like" is a little quirky - they show up in <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmention.io</a> as a "reply" with a single emoji as the "content".</p>
<p>Using the Ruby <a href="https://github.com/jollygoodcode/twemoji">twemoji</a> library, my site checks the "content" of a reply against the emoji index and, if the content is a single emoji, pulls it out of the usual "reply" display and puts it in a facepile. The emoji itself is shown as an icon in the corner of the little face image.</p>

</figure>
<p>While I was at it, I cleaned up a lot of my webmention-handling template to make things much clearer. This will make things easier for folks that want to re-use this code when I (eventually) release this as a Jekyll plugin.</p>
<p>Tonight is a <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-04-05-homebrew-website-club">Homebrew Website Club night</a>, but Baltimore is not having another official meetup until <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2017-04-19-homebrew-website-club#US_East">April 19th</a>. Still, I wanted to get something done to continue my deal with <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">Jonathan</a> to post something <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> related at least once per week.</p>

<p>I recently added support for <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/03/22/003710/">displaying mentions</a>, such as likes, reposts, comments, etc. from around the web that refer to the posts on my site. One thing the update <b>didn&rsquo;t</b> do is catch another type of mention, such as when someone mentions me in a tweet (<a href="https://twitter.com/DnDSVU/status/846544496728965122">example</a>). These get fed to my website by <a href="https://brid.gy/">brid.gy</a>, but weren&rsquo;t displayed anywhere.</p>
<p>So, I created a <a href="https://martymcgui.re/mentions/">/mentions page</a> for displaying these mentions. In the future, when a post mentions my homepage, the result will show up on the mentions page.</p>

</figure>
<p>My mentions still don&rsquo;t yet update in real time - they are compiled into my site whenever I make a new post. That&rsquo;s coming up in the future, but I <b>have</b> taken one more step towards real-time interactions with notifications!</p>
<p><a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a>, the service that I use for accepting and storing webmentions, has a <a href="https://indieweb.org/webhook">WebHook</a> option that can notify your site whenever a new webmention has been received. I wrote up a simple Python service using Flask that will listen for these messages from webmention.io and send them to me via <a href="https://pushbullet.com/">PushBullet</a>, a notification service that I&rsquo;ve been using for a while for other projects.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;ll see a notification on my phone and laptop when another site sends me a webmention!</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> Here&rsquo;s an example notification!</p>

<p>I write a text script for each of these audio editions, which I would like to find a way to add to the post as a transcript for the audio. A couple of (silly?) things stopping me: (1) I&rsquo;m not sure of the best way to lay that out and mark it up for the widest use and (2) My script format includes lots of notes-to-self that need to be cleaned up, adding yet-another-editing-task to getting this podcast out. :}</p>

  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/03/11/124355/">Baltimore's Marty 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on Mar 22nd.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p>martymcgui.re has been busy since the last meeting. Added tags and displaying webmentions to his site. Launched <a href="https://screech.schmarty.net/">Screech</a>, a micropub client for posting audio. Uses it to post an audio edition of the <a href="https://martymcgui.re/tag/this-week-indieweb-podcast/">This Week in the IndieWeb as a podcast</a>. Started looking into better reply contexts for sites with no microformats2 info, maybe starting with Soundcloud (which requires using their API to convert permalinks into embeds) or using Aaron Parecki's X-Ray.</p>
<p>
  brianey.com missed the last meeting, so it's been a while. Working on a new site at <a href="http://thebrianyoung.com">thebrianyoung.com</a>, set up his WordPress network to include IndieWeb plugins, including things like accepting Webmentions. Some small updates to <a href="http://imnotwrong.com/">imnotwrong.com</a>. Committing to more (of everything) for next time.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  eddiehinkle.com started blogging again back in February. Dusted off Jekyll and started delving back into IndieWeb. Reads a lot of books and wanted to have that info on his site from Goodreads. Uses a Node.js script to dump Goodreads data into Jekyll _data/ folder. Added microformats to pages. Posts project 365 photos to site, a little bit of a burden since everything is still manual. Current project is micropub. Plan is to set up a Node.js "controller" because he wants to do more responses and interactive things. Today added "On This Day", showing posts from the same day in previous years
  <br />
</p>
<p>maryreisenwitz.com was in the other half of the room working on laser-cutting projects, but did talk informally about wanting to add e-commerce to her site.</p>
<p>We discussed the shutdown of App.net, the upcoming micro.blog, the challenges of building everything yourself, and some of the laser-cutting projects that our host Mary was working on for an event next weekend.</p>

  <h1 class="post-title p-name"><a href="/2017/03/22/site-updates-displaying-webmentions/">Site updates: Displaying Webmentions!</a></h1>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  
  
    
    <div class="post e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/">Webmentions</a> are one of the most interesting and powerful technologies floating around the IndieWeb. At their most basic, they sites on the web to interact by sending a notification when a page on one site links to a page on another. When combined with machine-readable metadata like <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2">microformats2</a>, they enable really neat social interactions between sites, feeding back likes, comments, bookmarks, shares, event RSVPs, and plenty more.</p>
<h2>Receiving Webmentions</h2>
<p>A site doesn't have to do all its own Webmention handling, and there are a few services that will handle them for you. I set up my website with the <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a> service back in <i>August 2016</i> (so long ago!) and it's been accepting mentions from other sites since then. And, while there aren't a lot of websites that send Webmentions natively, there are services like <a href="https://brid.gy/">Bridgy</a> which uses Webmentions to <a href="https://indieweb.org/backfeed">backfeed</a> social interactions to my site from sites like Facebook and Twitter. Pretty neat!</p>
<h2>Sending Webmentions</h2>
<p>When I publish a post with a link to a site that support Webmentions, I still need to actually <i>send</i> that notification. I haven't yet built a tool that does that for my own website, but I have been able to make use of <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">Aaron Parecki</a>'s <a href="https://telegraph.p3k.io/">Telegraph</a>, which will take in a link to one of my posts and parse it for outgoing links, find out of the targets of those links support Webmentions, and allow me to send them with the press of a button. It's ridiculously easy to use and has the added benefit of letting me pick-and-choose which links go out as Webmentions.</p>
<h2>Displaying Webmentions</h2>
<p>Webmention.io has been collecting mentions for my site for something like 6 months, but they don't just magically show up on my site! Webmention.io <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io#api">provides an API</a> for fetching the mention data for individual pages, or all mentions for my domain.</p>
<p>My site is built on Jekyll, a static site generator, and I like that so far it doesn't rely on JavaScript for folks to read it. I didn't want to require JavaScript for displaying mentions, so I needed a way to "bake in" my mentions for each post. I was inspired by <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/">Aaron Gustafson</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io">jekyll-webmention_io</a>, but found that I didn't like some of the choices in markup or the way that it stored the mention data, so I went ahead and wrote my own. It's still heavily a work-in-progress, but I do hope to release it for other folks to use once it's more stable.</p>
<p>What works? Let's see!</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2016/12/12/093528/">an example post</a> with some Likes and RSVPs (both "yes"es and "maybe"s):</p>
<figure>
  <img class="img-responsive" src="https://media.martymcgui.re/7e/42/84/cc/aad81aba1837e97f651ceab40ec487943458e99a20e4d77298c21824.png" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>And <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/03/17/133511/">an example post with some replies</a> backfed from Facebook:</p>
<figure>
  <img class="img-responsive" src="https://media.martymcgui.re/3d/01/bf/2a/de0a04bfde5dbdb259462c912c4b3609b7ec98918f05003707be149e.png" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>All of these are being displayed with the data that Webmention.io provides with its API, and there are some types of post that I would like to handle differently such as the ❤️ above (which was a Facebook "heart" reaction), and I'd like to include a JavaScript enhancement that will show any new mentions, so they aren't sitting in "limbo" until I make a new post.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm really excited to finally be showing these on my site! I think Webmention is a pretty critical part of bringing the "social web" into the IndieWeb and back out of the silos. I am grateful to all the folks that have made this possible with their work on standards and tools!</p>

  <p>Earlier this week I <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/03/14/183924/">announced Screech</a>, a simple client for posting audio content (such as podcasts) to your own site using Micropub.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that <a href="https://screech.schmarty.net/">Screech is now available publicly</a>. You can check it out at <a href="https://screech.schmarty.net/">https://screech.schmarty.net/</a>.</p>

<p>Screech also now has an adorable logo, thanks to a couple of pieces of public domain art.</p>

  <h1 class="post-title p-name"><a href="/2017/03/14/screech---a-micropub-client-for-podcasting/">Screech - a micropub client for podcasting</a></h1>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  
  
    
    <div class="post e-content">
<p>I've been working on my idea of what <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> podcast publishing looks like for some months now, both with the improvised <a href="https://wehavetoask.com/">We Have to Ask comedy podcast</a> that I make with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JMonroe06">Jonathan Monroe</a> and more recently with the <a href="https://martymcgui.re/tag/this-week-indieweb-podcast/">This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition</a> that I started producing last month.</p>
<p>In addition to following standard IndieWeb-friendly practices like using <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-feed">microformats2 feeds</a>, backfeeding social interactions from Twitter and Facebook with <a href="https://brid.gy/">bridgy</a>, and exploring other interesting <a href="https://indieweb.org/audio">audio markup tricks</a>, I wanted a tool that made it easy for me to publish new content to my sites via the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/">Micropub protocol</a>, which supports sending audio media files.</p>
<p>I didn't see another micropub client in the wild that supported audio files in the way that I wanted, so I made my own.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/screech">Screech</a> is an audio-publishing-focused micropub web client with a Python server component built on Flask. Screech supports logging in with your own site using <a href="https://indieweb.org/indieauth">indieauth</a> and posts to your site's micropub endpoint.</p>
<p>It's still a work-in-progress, but the basic flows work well enough for my needs.</p>
<figure>
  <img class="img-responsive" src="https://media.martymcgui.re/d4/c6/65/cc/910d7b14b7dc979ed02ff13f3ee36c4919232c3835523504cfbc5cc2.png" alt="Screenshot of main Screech posting interface with form fields." />
  <figcaption>Screech interface before posting an episode of This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One fun feature of Screech is that once you select an MP3 file for upload, it uses the <a href="https://github.com/aadsm/jsmediatags">jsmediatags</a> library to pull out information about the track, such as its duration, track title, album and artist info, etc. This info is outside the scope of the Micropub standard, but if you want to add support to your server, you'll see those properties arrive with names like "id3-title", "id3-artist", etc.</p>
<p><strong><em>Edit, March 17, 2017</em></strong> &mdash; Screech is available at <a href="https://screech.schmarty.net/">screech.schmarty.net</a>. If you'd like to run it yourself, add features, or fix bugs, you can find the source code and instructions <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/screech">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>There are many TODOs yet on my plate for Screech before I'd consider it "done", such as micropub media endpoint support, syndication support, adding a photo to the post as a "poster" image, and more.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear feedback from the IndieWeb community! What do you think it means to be an "IndieWeb podcaster"? What features would make Screech useful for you?</p>

  <p>Audio edition for <a href="https://indieweb.org/this-week/2017-03-10.html">This Week in the IndieWeb for March 3th - 10th, 2017</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone for the feedback so far! In responding to a couple of listener requests, I slowed my speaking rate down for this week&rsquo;s updates. However, because I am re-using some common clips, it sounds like I am speeding up and slowing down quite a bit. My apologies for any confusion this causes! I plan to re-record the common samples soon.</p>

</p>
<p>In general, this means that you should make posts on your own site, then copy the post to silos like Twitter, Facebook, etc., to reach the folks in those communities. To complete the process, include links on your site from the original post out to the syndicated copies.</p>
<p>One fun reason to do this is that tools like <a href="https://brid.gy/">brid.gy</a> use syndication links in order to <a href="https://indieweb.org/backfeed">backfeed</a> comments and reactions from silos like Facebook and Twitter to your own site.</p>
<p>I'd been collecting these links for a while and displaying them in a "hidden" way - so tools like bridgy could see them, but a human reading the page would not.</p>

<p>Yesterday I added a "See also:" section that includes links out to any syndicated copies of my posts on other sites.</p>

    <div class="p-summary">
        Further to my note about a new #podcast about #indieweb things, I listened to Marty McGuire&#39;s rendering of This Week in the Indieweb. I really enjoyed it, even though I had read the text version. Production and audio were top notch, and it was very clear. My only quibbles concern …

    <div class="post e-content">
<p><a href="https://stream.jeremycherfas.net/profile/jeremy">Jeremy</a> raises some great points here that mirror some of my own worries about trying to summarize the discussions happening on the IndieWeb wiki and the many #indieweb chat channels.</p>

<p>When I had the initial idea to do an &ldquo;audio edition&rdquo; of <a href="https://indieweb.org/this-week">This Week in the IndieWeb</a>, the question of &ldquo;who is the audience&rdquo; seemed to have an obvious answer: folks who would read the newsletter but preferred an audio edition.</p>

<p>However, it quickly became clear that doing a &ldquo;direct read&rdquo; of the newsletter — where much of the content is names and links to changes on wiki pages — wouldn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense when spoken aloud. So, my first crack at the format evolved into answering a slightly broader question: &ldquo;how can I explain these updates to someone who might not already be familiar with the wiki?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My short (and unhelpful) answer is: this is hard. The discussions on the wiki tend to be very technical, jargon-heavy, and touch on an extremely wide set of topics. In the first episode, I attempted to give some structure with groupings like &ldquo;IndieWeb Events&rdquo;, &ldquo;Software and Services&rdquo;, &ldquo;Silo Updates&rdquo;, &ldquo;Silo Issues&rdquo;, etc., but I agree with Jeremy that it is still very fast and dense. While I want to keep the podcast short (less than 10 minutes), I think a next positive step would be to give topics more time to breathe with some <a href="https://www.npr.org/player/embed/504482252/505487421">explanatory commas</a> that give context.</p>

<p>It is my hope that projects like this podcast will help find new ways to phrase and frame the things that the IndieWeb community are doing and talking about, helping to reach new folks. I have a feeling it is going to be a lot of work. :}</p>

<p>Over the weekend I created an <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/02/18/151503/">English audio version</a> of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/this-week/2017-02-17.html">most recent This Week in the IndieWeb newsletter</a>. This led to some <a href="https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-02-18#t1487452020699000">great discussion in the #indieweb chat</a> about improvements and next-steps in creating a podcast from audio posts on one's own website. Today I added a couple of features to my site towards that end.</p>
<p>First up, I added support for "<a href="https://indieweb.org/tag_aggregation">tag aggregations</a>" - essentially, pages that list all posts with a certain tag. So, any future editions of this audio newsletter that I post can be tagged with "this-week-indieweb-podcast" and will then show up on the "<a href="https://martymcgui.re/tag/this-week-indieweb-podcast/">This Week in the IndieWeb Podcast</a>" page. It should <a href="https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/102">soon be possible</a> to feed that page to a tool like <a href="https://github.com/snarfed/granary">Granary</a> to convert the feed on that page, with its <a href="https://indieweb.org/audio">audio</a> entries, into an RSS feed suitable for subscribing with a podcast app.</p>
<p>Next up, I added support for "<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/">Media Fragments</a>", a W3C recommendation that allows linking to a specific timestamp to start (and even stop!) playback of video and audio. Aaron Parecki's recently <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2017/02/19/4/day-61-media-fragments">implemented this on his own site</a> and was kind enough to share the implementation! Now, you can create links that jump to a specific time of any audio or video post on my site.</p>
<p>
  For example, if you want to quickly jump to the part of the This Week in the IndieWeb audio edition that contains info about the next upcoming Homebrew Website Club meetings, it looks like this: <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/02/18/151503/#t=54">https://martymcgui.re/2017/02/18/151503/#t=54</a>
  <br />
</p>
<p>Media fragments could enable some fun things, such as a list of links that index directly to particular sections of a long recording.</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2017/02/19/4/day-61-media-fragments">Aaron also documented a fun way to use media fragments for attribution of other people's audio or video posts</a>. For example, my audio newsletter made use of several of Aaron Parecki's pieces from his <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/tag/100daysofmusic">100DaysOfMusic</a> project. I gave attribution by linking to Aaron's posts from my post, and because Aaron's site supports <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/">Webmentions</a>, you can see that <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2016/12/31/15/#mentions">my post shows up in the "mentions" list for one of the clips I used</a>. With media fragment support, it should be possible to have the mentions on Aaron's post link directly to the exact portion of my audio post where it appears!
  <br />
</p>
<p>Features like this give me hope that it could be possible to make an IndieWeb podcasting experience that is richer and more interactive than the <a href="http://boffosocko.com/2017/02/16/podcast-directories-why-cant-we/">current directory model</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/01/27/163523/">Baltimore's February 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on Feb 8th.</p>
<p>Notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>martymcgui.re - reworked his micropub server to support the media endpoint he was working on last time. also added venue pages to his site for event locations. made progress on event-posting micropub client (eventually will be released publicly). also added support for deleted posts with dt-deleted and meta http-equiv status 410 gone.</p>
<p>jonathanprozzi.net - refactoring site templates. spent a lot of time debugging some simple problems, h-cards. wants to figure out a way to track incremental work on website when other work things are crazy so threads don't get lost. wants to keep segmenting his Hugo template while maintaining mf2 stuff. goal is to get to working on appearance of his site theme.</p>
<p>
  jjuran.org - currently working on a <a href="http://www.jjuran.org/cv/projects/">CV on his site</a>. first use of img srcset to feed high-res images to clients that want them. uses his own Perl-based static site generator that is "showing its age". working on his own programming language so he can spend most of his time writing code in a high-level language.
  <br />
</p>
<p>We discussed the challenges of building your own tools for fun vs. starting from the goal of posting more (e.g. via Wordpress).</p>

  <h1 class="post-title p-name"><a href="/2017/01/26/spano---a-minimum-viable-micropub-media-endpoint/">Spano - a minimum-viable Micropub Media Endpoint</a></h1>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  
  
    
    <div class="post e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/">Micropub</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;an open API standard to create posts on one's own domain using third-party clients &nbsp;and currently a W3C Candidate Recommendation. One of the (semi-) recent additions is the idea of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#media-endpoint">Micropub Media Endpoint</a>. The Media Endpoint provides&nbsp;a way for Micropub clients to upload media files to a Micropub service, receiving a URL that is sent along in place of the file contents when the post is published.</p><p class="">Some of the things I like about Micropub media endpoints include:</p><ul><li>The spec allows the media endpoint to be on a completely separate domain from the "full" micropub endpoint.</li><li>The spec doesn't specify anything about how the files are stored or their final URLs or filenames.<br></li><li>They make it easy to separate the handling of (large) media files from the (presumably much smaller) content and metadata of a post.</li><li>They enable Micropub clients to upload multiple files without creating multiple posts. This makes it simpler to create posts that contain multiple images, like a gallery.</li></ul><p class="">Personally, I wanted a Micropub media endpoint server with a few extra properties:</p><ul><li>It should be able to run completely separately from, and therefore work in conjunction with, any other micropub server implementation.<br></li><li>It should not store duplicate files. If the same file is uploaded twice, the same URL should be returned both times.</li><li>It should not allow overwriting files. If two images of the same name are uploaded, both are kept and receive different URLs.</li></ul><h2>Enter HashFS</h2><p class="">My extra features above essentially describe a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">content-addressable storage</a>&nbsp;storage system. CAS is a way of storing and accessing data based on some property of the actual content, rather than (potentially arbitrary) files and folders.</p><p class=""><a href="https://hashfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">HashFS</a>&nbsp;is a Python implementation of a content-addressable file management system. You give it files, it will put them in a directory structure based on a <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic hash function</a>&nbsp;of the contents of that file. In other words - HashFS can take any file and give back a unique path to that file which will never change (if you later upload a new version of the file, it gets a different path).<br></p><p class="">To add the the fun of HashFS, there is a Flask extension called <a href="https://flask-hashfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Flask-HashFS</a>&nbsp;which makes it easy to expose a HashFS file store on the web via the Python&nbsp;<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>&nbsp;framework.</p><h2>Introducing Spano</h2><p class=""><a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/spano">Spano</a> is a Micropub Media Endpoint server written in Python via the Flask framework which combines Flask-HashFS for file storage with&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/Flask-IndieAuth">Flask-IndieAuth</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/01/26/104730/">introduced earlier</a>) to handle authentication and authorization.</p><p class="">Spano is a server-side web app that basically does one thing: it accepts HTTP POST requests with a valid <a href="http://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a>&nbsp;token and a file named "file", stores that file, and returns a URL to that file. The task of serving uploaded files is left to a dedicated web server like nginx or Apache.</p><h3>Using Spano</h3><p class="">Once Spano has been <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/spano#spano">set up and configured</a>&nbsp;for your domain, uploading is a matter of getting a valid IndieAuth token. IndieAuth-enabled Micropub clients will do this automatically. For testing by hand I like to log in to Quill and copy the access token from the <a href="https://quill.p3k.io/settings">Quill settings page</a>. With token in hand, uploads are as easy as:</p><pre><code>curl -D - -F "file=@myfile.jpg" \
  -H"Authorization: Bearer xxxx..." \
  https://media.example.com/micropub/</code></pre><p class="">Which should output a response like:</p><pre><code>HTTP/1.1 100 Continue

HTTP/1.0 201 CREATED
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 108
Location: https://media.example.com/cc/a5/97/7c/2004..2cb.jpg
Server: Werkzeug/0.11.4 Python/2.7.11
Date: Thu, 26 Jan 2017 02:40:05 GMT

File created: https://media.example.com/cc/a5/97/7c/2004..2cb.jpg</code></pre><h3>Integrating Spano with your Micropub Endpoint</h3><p class="">If you want Micropub clients to use Spano as your Media Endpoint, you need to advertise it. This is handled by your "main" Micropub server using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#discovery">discovery</a>. Essentially, a client will make a configuration request to your server like so:</p><pre>https://example.com/micropub?q=config</pre><p class="">And your server's response should be a JSON-formatted object specifying the "media-endpoint". A bare minimum example:</p><pre>{<br>&nbsp; "media-endpoint": "https://media.example.com/micropub/"<br>}</pre><p class="">In addition to advertising the media-endpoint, your Micropub server must be able to handle lists of URLs in places where it would normally expect a file.</p><p class="">For example, when posting a photo from Quill without a media endpoint, your Micropub server will receive a multipart/form-data encoded file named "photo". When posting from Quill with a media endpoint, your Micropub server will instead receive a list of URLs represented as "photo[]=https://media.example.com/cc/...2cb.jpg". Presumably this pattern would hold for other media types such as video and audio, if you are using Micropub clients that support them.</p><p class="">This particular step has been an interesting challenge for my site, which is a static site generated by Jekyll. My previous Micropub file-handling implementation expected all uploaded assets to live on disk next to the post files, and updating my Jekyll theme and plugins to handle the change is a work in progress. I eventually plan to move all my uploads out of the source for my project in favor of storing them with Spano.</p><h2>Feedback Welcome!</h2><p class="">Spano is probably my second public Python project, so I'd love feedback! If you try it out and run into issues, please drop me a line <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/spano/issues">on GitHub</a>. Or you can find me in the <a href="https://chat.indieweb.org/">#indieweb chat</a> on freenode IRC.</p><p class="">I'd also like to thank Kyle Mahan for his <a href="https://github.com/kylewm/woodwind">Woodwind</a>&nbsp;Flask server application, which inspired the structure of Spano.</p>

<p class="">One of the things I like about the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>&nbsp;community is that while they are <a href="https://indieweb.org/selfdogfood">building tools for themselves</a>, they also tend to <a href="https://github.com/tantek/cassis">release</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/XRay">useful</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/kylewm/flask-micropub">parts</a>&nbsp;under Free Software licenses. This helps other developers join the community more quickly, but it also tends to help improve the quality and feature sets of these projects as others use and add to the source.<br></p><p class="">One of my favorite things to come from the IndieWeb folks is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/">Micropub API standard</a>, which defines some simple protocols for clients to send post data (the kinds of things you'd share on a blog or social media: images, short plain text, long articles, tags, and more) to servers for posting. One upshot is that if your server accepts Micropub, you can use one of many clients to put content on your site. I'm using a dedicated editor from&nbsp;<a href="https://quill.p3k.io/">Aaron Parecki's Quill</a> to write this post, but there are <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients">lots of alternatives</a>&nbsp;that are aimed at special use cases. For example, <a href="https://woodwind.xyz">Kyle Mahan's Woodwind</a>&nbsp;is an IndieWeb reader app that happens to include functionality for posting replies, favorites, reposts, and even RSVPs directly to my site via Micropub.</p><p class="">Another favorite is the idea of&nbsp;<a href="http://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a>&nbsp;for web sign-in. At a high level, the idea is that you create two-way links between your website and your user profile on some other silo. For example, on your homepage you add a link to your Twitter profile and on your Twitter profile you link back to your homepage. For a client that supports IndieAuth, I can log in using my homepage URL by verifying that I can log in to my Twitter account.</p><p class="">My own personal Micropub implementation is a little pile of spaghetti Python code making use of the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>&nbsp;framework. I use IndieAuth to handle authentication (i.e. - proving that a post comes from an app that I've logged into) and authorization (i.e. - proving that I gave that app permission to post to my site). As I've started improving my Micropub implementation, I found it useful to extract that portion of my code into a library that can be used with other Flask applications.</p><h2>Introducing Flask-IndieAuth</h2><p class=""><a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/Flask-IndieAuth">Flask-IndieAuth</a>&nbsp;is a Flask extension that adds the ability to require a client to send a valid IndieAuth token when making requests to any route. For example:</p><pre>from flask_indieauth import requires_indieauth

@app.route('/micropub', methods=['GET','POST'])
@requires_indieauth
def handle_micropub():
    # ... handle the request</pre><p class="">The @requires_indieauth decorator runs before the code for the route. It currently looks for an IndieAuth token in one of three places, in order:</p><ul><li>HTTP Header (e.g. "Authorization: Bearer xxxx...xx")<br></li><li>HTTP form data or query string (e.g. "?access_token=xxxx...xx")</li><li>The body of a JSON-encoded POST (e.g. {"access_token": "xxxx...xx"})</li></ul><p class="">If a token is found, it will be verified against the configured <a href="https://indieweb.org/token-endpoint">Token Endpoint</a>&nbsp;to confirm that it is a valid token issued for your server's configured homepage with a sufficient scope.</p><p class="">For more information on how to install, configure, and use Flask-IndieAuth, please check out the <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/Flask-IndieAuth#README">README on GitHub</a>.</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p class="">I'll be using this extension to build my <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#media-endpoint">Micropub media endpoint</a>&nbsp;(coming up in a future post) and so far it is working just fine. That said, I know there is a lot of room for improvement. Some things on my list:</p><ul><li>"scope" can have many values, but only "post" is supported for now. It should probably be passed as an argument to @requires_indieauth so different routes can have different requirements.<br></li><li>The configured homepage ("ME") is currently expected in the Flask app's config. I'm not sure if that's "standard".</li><li>"TOKEN_ENDPOINT" is currently expected in the Flask app's configuration, but since it is required to be specified in the HTTP headers for or as a &lt;link&gt; in the content for the homepage, this could be fetched by the server.</li><li>Error handling isn't great - all failure conditions currently return HTTP 400 (Bad Request) but should probably be diversified a bit.</li></ul><h2>Feedback Welcome!</h2><p class="">This is my first published Flask extension (heck, it's my first public Python package on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a>), and I'd really appreciate comments, questions, pull requests, etc. Feel free to reach out <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/Flask-IndieAuth/issues">on GitHub</a>, or you can find me in the <a href="https://chat.indieweb.org/">#indieweb chat</a> on freenode IRC.</p>

<p class=""><a href="https://martymcgui.re/2016/12/30/175607/">Baltimore's first Homebrew Website Club of 2017</a> met at the <a href="http://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on 2017-01-25.</p><p class="">Notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:<br></p><p class="">martymcgui.re - mf2 for deleted posts. Packaged and released his first Python package, a Flask IndieAuth lib for micropub servers, has a proof of concept micropub media server built on Flask-HashFS.</p><p class="">brianey.com - lots of WordPress IndieWeb plugins setup on his site. Has IndieAuth working. Thinks micropub is working. Also integrating these into humor/fake-advice site imnotwrong.com, POSSE to Medium. Discovered that people still use StumbleUpon and got some good traffic from there.</p><p class="">jeancedre.com - wrote down list of things to do to refresh portfolio site. Chose new color scheme and brought it into Sketch to start designing. New website will mean new logo, layout, etc., and eventually business cards based on that. Not sure if wants to use WordPress "because it's overkill". Discussed how he wants to "use" the site, as the author, since WP provides a nice CMS that supports lots of workflows.</p><p class="">jonathanprozzi.net - did lots of refactoring of his Hugo theme into logical partials. Goal is to make a Hugo theme that supports IndieWeb via mf2 out of the box. Has also started making an ongoing list of all the changes he has been making, or wants to make, on his site.<br></p><p class="">We discussed the renewed IndieWeb interest in automatically archiving our posts and links to the Internet Archive, prompted by the content deletions and Twitter censoring of the new U.S. gov't administration. We also discussed the upcoming <a href="http://cryptoparty.in/baltimore">CryptoParty Baltimore happening in a little over a week on Feb 4th</a>.</p><div class="medium-insert-images ui-sortable"><figure>

    <div class="post e-content">
<p class="">A couple of days ago I wrote up a set of instructions for <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2016/11/28/124055/">setting up a self-hosted copy of Woodwind with nginx and upstart</a>. Since then I noticed that many images were broken on the feeds I was looking at - a common problem when a site that is served with HTTPS is displaying images and other content from another site that is served with HTTP.</p><div class="medium-insert-images ui-sortable"><figure>
    <img src="https://media.martymcgui.re/00/eb/b7/cb/64d4d3c006585e950d0a743ad2c6b4b443f8336bee2c696b26520657.png" alt="" class="ui-sortable-handle">
        
<figcaption class="">Broken images are so 90s. But, like, sad 90s.</figcaption></figure></div><p class="">I noticed that the main site woodwind.xyz was serving images through special URLs like:</p><pre>https://woodwind.xyz/imageproxy/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmartymcgui.re%2Fimages%2Flogo.jpg&amp;op=noop&amp;sig=...</pre><p class="">Looking in the source code, I found that <a href="https://woodwind.xyz/imageproxy/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmartymcgui.re%2Fimages%2Flogo.jpg&amp;op=noop&amp;sig=73d286817747f1ed807dfa23fba0d381d0d104ca">Woodwind has support for image proxies</a>, which are neat little services that can help serve remote HTTP content over HTTPS, resize images on the fly, and more.</p><p class="">I'd been meaning to set up one of these services for my own site, so this seemed like a good time to jump in!</p><p class="">Since my server already has <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> I chose <a href="https://github.com/willnorris/imageproxy">Will Norris' imageproxy</a>, which has a similar deployment setup to how I am already running Woodwind: Upstart manages a standalone process and nginx acts as a proxy to pass along requests.</p><p class="">Installation was fairly simple, once I had my GOPATH set up correctly:</p><pre>go get https://github.com/willnorris/imageproxy</pre><p class="">For running a persistent service, Will has an <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/willnorris/imageproxy/master/etc/imageproxy.conf">example Upstart configuration</a>, which I modified a bit and placed in /etc/init/imageproxy.conf:</p><pre><code>description "Image Proxy server"
start on (net-device-up)
stop on runlevel [!2345]

respawn
exec start-stop-daemon --start -c www-data --exec /home/imageproxy_user/go/bin/imageproxy -- \
    -addr localhost:4593 \
    -log_dir /var/log/imageproxy \
    -cache /var/cache/imageproxy \
    -signatureKey @/etc/imageproxy.key</code></pre><p class="">Before starting up the service, there were a few extra steps:</p><p class="">Create /var/log/imageproxy and /var/cache/imageproxy and make sure they are owned by the www-data user.</p><p class="">Create the "<a href="https://github.com/willnorris/imageproxy/#signed-requests">signature key</a>" in /etc/imageproxy.key. This is used to authorize each image request so that random folks can't proxy random stuff through your imageproxy. I used the command line openssl tool for this, with an extra pass through awk to remove the newline character that openssl spits out.</p><pre>$ sudo openssl rand -base64 42 | awk 'BEGIN{ORS="";} {print} &gt; /etc/imageproxy.key</pre><p class="">I also made sure that /etc/imageproxy.key was owned and readable by www-data and no other user.</p><p class="">I could then start up the server with:</p><pre>sudo start imageproxy</pre><p class="">Next it was time to configure nginx to send proxied image requests along to imageproxy. I opened up the nginx woodwind.conf file that I had created and added a new location block:</p><pre>location ~ ^/imageproxy/ {<br>        # pattern match to capture the original URL to prevent URL<br>        # canonicalization, which would strip double slashes<br>        if ($request_uri ~ "/imageproxy/(.+)") {<br>            set $path $1;<br>            rewrite .* /$path break;<br>        }<br>        proxy_pass http://localhost:4593;<br>    }</pre><p class="">After restarting nginx, requests to https://woodwind.yourdomain.com/imageproxy/... would be forwarded to the imageproxy server.</p><p class="">Finally, it was time to configure Woodwind to use the proxy. I opened up woodwind.cfg and added two lines:</p><pre>IMAGEPROXY_URL = '/imageproxy'<br>IMAGEPROXY_KEY = '...' # the contents of /etc/imageproxy.key</pre><p class="">A quick restart of the Woodwind service, a browser refresh and I have images aplenty!</p><div class="medium-insert-images ui-sortable"><figure>

</figure></div><p class="">Thanks for reading! I hope this little HOWTO was useful. I look forward to more fun with imageproxy in my IndieWeb adventures. How might you be able to put imageproxy to use?</p>

    <div class="post e-content">
<p class="">One of my favorite aspects of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>&nbsp;community is that when you get things "right" with your website, you often get a bunch of fun interoperability with other IndieWeb-compatible websites "for free". For example, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/">Micropub</a>&nbsp;standard lets you use lots of different clients to post to your own site, and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/">Webmention</a>&nbsp;standard lets sites notify one another of things like comments, event RSVPs, etc.</p><p class="">Fundamental to having these technologies work well together is <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2">microformats2</a>&nbsp;(mf2), a lightweight way of marking up "structural information" in HTML so that a machine can make (some) sense of the information, such as the name, url, and photo of the author, hints on the important pieces of content in a page, etc.</p><p class="">Getting these things "right" on my own website led me to look for a "<a href="http://indieweb.org/reader">Reader</a>" that would make use of the mf2 data and attempt to display it in a meaningful way.</p><p class="">One of the popular readers I saw talked about in the <a href="https://chat.indieweb.org/">#IndieWeb chat</a>&nbsp;was <a href="https://woodwind.xyz/">Woodwind</a>. It was easy to get started by <a href="http://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">logging in with my own website</a>&nbsp;and then subscribing to my own site to get all my h-feeds, h-entrys, h-cards, etc. in a row. Recently, the hosted version of Woodwind at https://woodwind.xyz/ was down for a few days, so I set out to host my own.</p><h2>Initial Setup</h2><p class="">Thankfully, <a href="https://github.com/kylewm/woodwind">Woodwind is on GitHub</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://github.com/kylewm/woodwind#installation">Installation instructions</a> are pretty good for getting started. Since I already had a server with the expected dependencies (Python3, PostgreSQL, and Redis), I was able to get a test site up and running in a few steps:</p><ol><li>clone the git repo<br><pre>git clone https://github.com/kylewm/woodwind.git
cd woodwind</pre></li><li>create Python3 virtualenv and activate it<br><pre>virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate<br></pre></li><li>install the required Python libraries with pip<br><pre>sudo apt-get install python3-dev
pip install -r requirements.txt</pre></li><li><p>as the postgres user, create the woodwind database and the database user that would access it</p><pre><code>$ sudo -u postgres createdb woodwind
$ sudo -u postgres psql woodwind
woodwind=# create user woodwind_user with password '...'</code></pre></li><li>copy woodwind.cfg.template to woodwind.cfg and edit it up<br><pre><p>SECRET_KEY = '...'
SERVER_NAME = 'woodwind.yourdomain.com'
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgres://woodwind_user:DB_PASSWORD@localhost/woodwind'</p></pre></li><li>run the init_db.py script<br><pre>python init_db.py</pre><ul><li>at this point I discovered a typo in <code>woodwind/views.py</code>&nbsp;that was throwing errors - a missing parenthesis. once fixed, this ran fine.</li><li>I've created a <a href="https://github.com/kylewm/woodwind/pull/63">pull request</a> for this, so kylewm can merge it back in eventually.</li></ul></li><li>finally, use&nbsp;<code>uwsgi</code> to run the demo version<br><pre>uwsgi woodwind-dev.ini</pre></li><li>visit localhost:3000 in my browser and I could see that woodwind was running!<br></li></ol><p class="">This had me off to a very good start, but I wanted to be able to visit my copy of Woodwind from anywhere using a public domain name, protect my activity from eavesdroppers on the network with HTTPS, and have Woodwind up and running reliably across server crashes, reboots, etc.</p><h2>Setting up Woodwind with uwsgi, Upstart, and nginx</h2><p class="">Woodwind is an application written in Python. <a href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">uwsgi</a>&nbsp;is an application server that can run that code on demand, efficiently. It is possible to run uwsgi by hand as we did above, but I wanted the service to be started and managed automatically by the operating system.</p><p class="">I run an Ubuntu server with the <a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/">upstart</a> process manager. So, I created an upstart configuration for Woodwind at /etc/init/woodwind.conf:</p><pre>description "woodwind uwsgi instance"<br>start on runlevel []<br>stop on runlevel []<br>respawn<br>setuid woodwind_user<br>setgid woodwind_user<br>chdir /home/woodwind_user/woodwind<br>env LC_ALL=C.UTF-8<br>export LC_ALL<br>env LANG=C.UTF-8<br>export LANG<br>script<br>	. venv/bin/activate<br>	uwsgi --ini woodwind.ini<br>end script</pre><p class="">With this, the uwsgi server should start up on boot to serve Woodwind, and I can now manage woodwind from the command line. For example:</p><pre><p>$ sudo start woodwind
woodwind start/running, process 14104
$ status woodwind
woodwind start/running, process 14104
$ sudo restart woodwind
woodwind start/running, process 14246
$ sudo stop woodwind
woodwind stop/waiting</p></pre><p class="">Since I wanted to use HTTPS to protect my activity on Woodwind from network eavesdropping, I used <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>&nbsp;and their <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">certbot</a> tool&nbsp;to create an SSL certificate for my domain. The steps are:</p><ol><li>Create a DNS entry for woodwind.yourdomain.com to point to the public IP address of my server. This may take some time to propagate and certbot won't work until it has taken effect.</li><li>Install <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">certbot</a></li><li>Stop nginx from running, temporarily.</li><li>Use certbot to issue a<br><pre><code>./certbot-auto certonly --standalone \
  --standalone-supported-challenges http-01 \
  -d woodwind.yourdomain.com</code></pre></li></ol><p class="">This resulted in an SSL certificate and key pair that I could use to encrypt traffic to this domain.</p><p class="">Next up, I need something to actually handle the HTTPS requests and pass them along to uwsgi. I used <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">nginx</a>&nbsp;for this because I was already using it on this server. In my nginx config directory, I created a woodwind.conf file:</p><pre>upstream woodwind {<br>  server unix:/tmp/woodwind.sock;<br>}<br>upstream woodwind_wss {<br>  server localhost:8077;<br>}<br>server {<br>  listen *:80;<br>  server_name woodwind.maktro.net;<br>  server_tokens off;<br>  ssl on;<br>  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/woodwind.yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;<br>  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/woodwind.yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;<br>  ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;<br>  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;<br>  ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;<br>  ssl_ciphers "EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256+EECDH:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256+EDH:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES256-SHA:AES128-SHA:DES-CBC3-SHA:HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4";<br>  ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem;<br>  root /home/woodwind_user/woodwind;<br>  access_log /var/log/nginx/woodwind_access.log;<br>  error_log /var/log/nginx/woodwind_error.log;<br>  location /_updates {<br>    uwsgi_pass woodwind_wss;<br>  }<br>  location / {<br>    try_files /woodwind/static/$uri /frontend/$uri @woodwind;<br>  }<br>  location @woodwind {<br>    uwsgi_pass woodwind;<br>    include uwsgi_params;<br>    uwsgi_buffering off;<br>  }<br>}</pre><p class="">This nginx configuration has some things worth noting:</p><ul><li>In addition to running a process that answers regular HTTP requests on a unix socket at /tmp/woodwind.sock, Woodwind also runs a service that answers WebSocket traffic at localhost:8077 for nifty features like live updating the page in your browser when a feed is updated.<br></li><li>Woodwind serves some static files out of its /woodwind/static folder as well as the /frontend folder. I needed to install the dependencies in /frontend using npm:<br><pre><code>$ cd frontend
$ npm install --nodev</code></pre></li></ul><p class="">After all this setup, I restarted nginx and was able to visit Woodwind in my browser!<br></p><p class="">I am happy with my setup so far. I am not quite sure yet if I did the WebSockets configuration correctly, but in general things seem to be working alright. I hope this information is useful to someone down the road, even if it is just future me.</p>
