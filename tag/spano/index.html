<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/">Micropub</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;an open API standard to create posts on one's own domain using third-party clients &nbsp;and currently a W3C Candidate Recommendation. One of the (semi-) recent additions is the idea of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#media-endpoint">Micropub Media Endpoint</a>. The Media Endpoint provides&nbsp;a way for Micropub clients to upload media files to a Micropub service, receiving a URL that is sent along in place of the file contents when the post is published.</p><p class="">Some of the things I like about Micropub media endpoints include:</p><ul><li>The spec allows the media endpoint to be on a completely separate domain from the "full" micropub endpoint.</li><li>The spec doesn't specify anything about how the files are stored or their final URLs or filenames.<br></li><li>They make it easy to separate the handling of (large) media files from the (presumably much smaller) content and metadata of a post.</li><li>They enable Micropub clients to upload multiple files without creating multiple posts. This makes it simpler to create posts that contain multiple images, like a gallery.</li></ul><p class="">Personally, I wanted a Micropub media endpoint server with a few extra properties:</p><ul><li>It should be able to run completely separately from, and therefore work in conjunction with, any other micropub server implementation.<br></li><li>It should not store duplicate files. If the same file is uploaded twice, the same URL should be returned both times.</li><li>It should not allow overwriting files. If two images of the same name are uploaded, both are kept and receive different URLs.</li></ul><h2>Enter HashFS</h2><p class="">My extra features above essentially describe a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">content-addressable storage</a>&nbsp;storage system. CAS is a way of storing and accessing data based on some property of the actual content, rather than (potentially arbitrary) files and folders.</p><p class=""><a href="https://hashfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">HashFS</a>&nbsp;is a Python implementation of a content-addressable file management system. You give it files, it will put them in a directory structure based on a <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic hash function</a>&nbsp;of the contents of that file. In other words - HashFS can take any file and give back a unique path to that file which will never change (if you later upload a new version of the file, it gets a different path).<br></p><p class="">To add the the fun of HashFS, there is a Flask extension called <a href="https://flask-hashfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Flask-HashFS</a>&nbsp;which makes it easy to expose a HashFS file store on the web via the Python&nbsp;<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>&nbsp;framework.</p><h2>Introducing Spano</h2><p class=""><a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/spano">Spano</a> is a Micropub Media Endpoint server written in Python via the Flask framework which combines Flask-HashFS for file storage with&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/Flask-IndieAuth">Flask-IndieAuth</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/01/26/104730/">introduced earlier</a>) to handle authentication and authorization.</p><p class="">Spano is a server-side web app that basically does one thing: it accepts HTTP POST requests with a valid <a href="http://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a>&nbsp;token and a file named "file", stores that file, and returns a URL to that file. The task of serving uploaded files is left to a dedicated web server like nginx or Apache.</p><h3>Using Spano</h3><p class="">Once Spano has been <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/spano#spano">set up and configured</a>&nbsp;for your domain, uploading is a matter of getting a valid IndieAuth token. IndieAuth-enabled Micropub clients will do this automatically. For testing by hand I like to log in to Quill and copy the access token from the <a href="https://quill.p3k.io/settings">Quill settings page</a>. With token in hand, uploads are as easy as:</p><pre><code>curl -D - -F "file=@myfile.jpg" \
  -H"Authorization: Bearer xxxx..." \
  https://media.example.com/micropub/</code></pre><p class="">Which should output a response like:</p><pre><code>HTTP/1.1 100 Continue

HTTP/1.0 201 CREATED
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 108
Location: https://media.example.com/cc/a5/97/7c/2004..2cb.jpg

This is handled by your "main" Micropub server using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#discovery">discovery</a>. Essentially, a client will make a configuration request to your server like so:</p><pre>https://example.com/micropub?q=config</pre><p class="">And your server's response should be a JSON-formatted object specifying the "media-endpoint". A bare minimum example:</p><pre>{<br>&nbsp; "media-endpoint": "https://media.example.com/micropub/"<br>}</pre><p class="">In addition to advertising the media-endpoint, your Micropub server must be able to handle lists of URLs in places where it would normally expect a file.</p><p class="">For example, when posting a photo from Quill without a media endpoint, your Micropub server will receive a multipart/form-data encoded file named "photo". When posting from Quill with a media endpoint, your Micropub server will instead receive a list of URLs represented as "photo[]=https://media.example.com/cc/...2cb.jpg". Presumably this pattern would hold for other media types such as video and audio, if you are using Micropub clients that support them.</p><p class="">This particular step has been an interesting challenge for my site, which is a static site generated by Jekyll. My previous Micropub file-handling implementation expected all uploaded assets to live on disk next to the post files, and updating my Jekyll theme and plugins to handle the change is a work in progress. I eventually plan to move all my uploads out of the source for my project in favor of storing them with Spano.</p><h2>Feedback Welcome!</h2><p class="">Spano is probably my second public Python project, so I'd love feedback! If you try it out and run into issues, please drop me a line <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/spano/issues">on GitHub</a>. Or you can find me in the <a href="https://chat.indieweb.org/">#indieweb chat</a> on freenode IRC.</p><p class="">I'd also like to thank Kyle Mahan for his <a href="https://github.com/kylewm/woodwind">Woodwind</a>&nbsp;Flask server application, which inspired the structure of Spano.</p>
