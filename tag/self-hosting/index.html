    <div class="post e-content">
<p class="">A couple of days ago I wrote up a set of instructions for <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2016/11/28/124055/">setting up a self-hosted copy of Woodwind with nginx and upstart</a>. Since then I noticed that many images were broken on the feeds I was looking at - a common problem when a site that is served with HTTPS is displaying images and other content from another site that is served with HTTP.</p><div class="medium-insert-images ui-sortable"><figure>
    <img src="https://media.martymcgui.re/00/eb/b7/cb/64d4d3c006585e950d0a743ad2c6b4b443f8336bee2c696b26520657.png" alt="" class="ui-sortable-handle">
        
<figcaption class="">Broken images are so 90s. But, like, sad 90s.</figcaption></figure></div><p class="">I noticed that the main site woodwind.xyz was serving images through special URLs like:</p><pre>https://woodwind.xyz/imageproxy/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmartymcgui.re%2Fimages%2Flogo.jpg&amp;op=noop&amp;sig=...</pre><p class="">Looking in the source code, I found that <a href="https://woodwind.xyz/imageproxy/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmartymcgui.re%2Fimages%2Flogo.jpg&amp;op=noop&amp;sig=73d286817747f1ed807dfa23fba0d381d0d104ca">Woodwind has support for image proxies</a>, which are neat little services that can help serve remote HTTP content over HTTPS, resize images on the fly, and more.</p><p class="">I'd been meaning to set up one of these services for my own site, so this seemed like a good time to jump in!</p><p class="">Since my server already has <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> I chose <a href="https://github.com/willnorris/imageproxy">Will Norris' imageproxy</a>, which has a similar deployment setup to how I am already running Woodwind: Upstart manages a standalone process and nginx acts as a proxy to pass along requests.</p><p class="">Installation was fairly simple, once I had my GOPATH set up correctly:</p><pre>go get https://github.com/willnorris/imageproxy</pre><p class="">For running a persistent service, Will has an <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/willnorris/imageproxy/master/etc/imageproxy.conf">example Upstart configuration</a>, which I modified a bit and placed in /etc/init/imageproxy.conf:</p><pre><code>description "Image Proxy server"
start on (net-device-up)
stop on runlevel [!2345]

respawn
exec start-stop-daemon --start -c www-data --exec /home/imageproxy_user/go/bin/imageproxy -- \
    -addr localhost:4593 \
    -log_dir /var/log/imageproxy \
    -cache /var/cache/imageproxy \
    -signatureKey @/etc/imageproxy.key</code></pre><p class="">Before starting up the service, there were a few extra steps:</p><p class="">Create /var/log/imageproxy and /var/cache/imageproxy and make sure they are owned by the www-data user.</p><p class="">Create the "<a href="https://github.com/willnorris/imageproxy/#signed-requests">signature key</a>" in /etc/imageproxy.key. This is used to authorize each image request so that random folks can't proxy random stuff through your imageproxy. I used the command line openssl tool for this, with an extra pass through awk to remove the newline character that openssl spits out.</p><pre>$ sudo openssl rand -base64 42 | awk 'BEGIN{ORS="";} {print} &gt; /etc/imageproxy.key</pre><p class="">I also made sure that /etc/imageproxy.key was owned and readable by www-data and no other user.</p><p class="">I could then start up the server with:</p><pre>sudo start imageproxy</pre><p class="">Next it was time to configure nginx to send proxied image requests along to imageproxy. I opened up the nginx woodwind.conf file that I had created and added a new location block:</p><pre>location ~ ^/imageproxy/ {<br>        # pattern match to capture the original URL to prevent URL<br>        # canonicalization, which would strip double slashes<br>        if ($request_uri ~ "/imageproxy/(.+)") {<br>            set $path $1;<br>            rewrite .* /$path break;<br>        }<br>        proxy_pass http://localhost:4593;<br>    }</pre><p class="">After restarting nginx, requests to https://woodwind.yourdomain.com/imageproxy/... would be forwarded to the imageproxy server.</p><p class="">Finally, it was time to configure Woodwind to use the proxy. I opened up woodwind.cfg and added two lines:</p><pre>IMAGEPROXY_URL = '/imageproxy'<br>IMAGEPROXY_KEY = '...' # the contents of /etc/imageproxy.key</pre><p class="">A quick restart of the Woodwind service, a browser refresh and I have images aplenty!</p><div class="medium-insert-images ui-sortable"><figure>
    <img src="https://media.martymcgui.re/60/d2/ee/c0/1ac78aaf7042e34cc941fa258f1c5005a5e32b603dc7f5830e269d46.png" alt="" class="ui-sortable-handle">
        
</figure></div><p class="">Thanks for reading! I hope this little HOWTO was useful. I look forward to more fun with imageproxy in my IndieWeb adventures. How might you be able to put imageproxy to use?</p>

    <div class="post e-content">
<p class="">One of my favorite aspects of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>&nbsp;community is that when you get things "right" with your website, you often get a bunch of fun interoperability with other IndieWeb-compatible websites "for free". For example, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/">Micropub</a>&nbsp;standard lets you use lots of different clients to post to your own site, and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/">Webmention</a>&nbsp;standard lets sites notify one another of things like comments, event RSVPs, etc.</p><p class="">Fundamental to having these technologies work well together is <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2">microformats2</a>&nbsp;(mf2), a lightweight way of marking up "structural information" in HTML so that a machine can make (some) sense of the information, such as the name, url, and photo of the author, hints on the important pieces of content in a page, etc.</p><p class="">Getting these things "right" on my own website led me to look for a "<a href="http://indieweb.org/reader">Reader</a>" that would make use of the mf2 data and attempt to display it in a meaningful way.</p><p class="">One of the popular readers I saw talked about in the <a href="https://chat.indieweb.org/">#IndieWeb chat</a>&nbsp;was <a href="https://woodwind.xyz/">Woodwind</a>. It was easy to get started by <a href="http://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">logging in with my own website</a>&nbsp;and then subscribing to my own site to get all my h-feeds, h-entrys, h-cards, etc. in a row. Recently, the hosted version of Woodwind at https://woodwind.xyz/ was down for a few days, so I set out to host my own.</p><h2>Initial Setup</h2><p class="">Thankfully, <a href="https://github.com/kylewm/woodwind">Woodwind is on GitHub</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://github.com/kylewm/woodwind#installation">Installation instructions</a> are pretty good for getting started. Since I already had a server with the expected dependencies (Python3, PostgreSQL, and Redis), I was able to get a test site up and running in a few steps:</p><ol><li>clone the git repo<br><pre>git clone https://github.com/kylewm/woodwind.git
cd woodwind</pre></li><li>create Python3 virtualenv and activate it<br><pre>virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate<br></pre></li><li>install the required Python libraries with pip<br><pre>sudo apt-get install python3-dev
pip install -r requirements.txt</pre></li><li><p>as the postgres user, create the woodwind database and the database user that would access it</p><pre><code>$ sudo -u postgres createdb woodwind
$ sudo -u postgres psql woodwind
woodwind=# create user woodwind_user with password '...'</code></pre></li><li>copy woodwind.cfg.template to woodwind.cfg and edit it up<br><pre><p>SECRET_KEY = '...'
SERVER_NAME = 'woodwind.yourdomain.com'
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgres://woodwind_user:DB_PASSWORD@localhost/woodwind'</p></pre></li><li>run the init_db.py script<br><pre>python init_db.py</pre><ul><li>at this point I discovered a typo in <code>woodwind/views.py</code>&nbsp;that was throwing errors - a missing parenthesis. once fixed, this ran fine.</li><li>I've created a <a href="https://github.com/kylewm/woodwind/pull/63">pull request</a> for this, so kylewm can merge it back in eventually.</li></ul></li><li>finally, use&nbsp;<code>uwsgi</code> to run the demo version<br><pre>uwsgi woodwind-dev.ini</pre></li><li>visit localhost:3000 in my browser and I could see that woodwind was running!<br></li></ol><p class="">This had me off to a very good start, but I wanted to be able to visit my copy of Woodwind from anywhere using a public domain name, protect my activity from eavesdroppers on the network with HTTPS, and have Woodwind up and running reliably across server crashes, reboots, etc.</p><h2>Setting up Woodwind with uwsgi, Upstart, and nginx</h2><p class="">Woodwind is an application written in Python. <a href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">uwsgi</a>&nbsp;is an application server that can run that code on demand, efficiently. It is possible to run uwsgi by hand as we did above, but I wanted the service to be started and managed automatically by the operating system.</p><p class="">I run an Ubuntu server with the <a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/">upstart</a> process manager. So, I created an upstart configuration for Woodwind at /etc/init/woodwind.conf:</p><pre>description "woodwind uwsgi instance"<br>start on runlevel []<br>stop on runlevel []<br>respawn<br>setuid woodwind_user<br>setgid woodwind_user<br>chdir /home/woodwind_user/woodwind<br>env LC_ALL=C.UTF-8<br>export LC_ALL<br>env LANG=C.UTF-8<br>export LANG<br>script<br>	. venv/bin/activate<br>	uwsgi --ini woodwind.ini<br>end script</pre><p class="">With this, the uwsgi server should start up on boot to serve Woodwind, and I can now manage woodwind from the command line. For example:</p><pre><p>$ sudo start woodwind
woodwind start/running, process 14104
$ status woodwind
woodwind start/running, process 14104
$ sudo restart woodwind
woodwind start/running, process 14246
$ sudo stop woodwind
woodwind stop/waiting</p></pre><p class="">Since I wanted to use HTTPS to protect my activity on Woodwind from network eavesdropping, I used <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>&nbsp;and their <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">certbot</a> tool&nbsp;to create an SSL certificate for my domain. The steps are:</p><ol><li>Create a DNS entry for woodwind.yourdomain.com to point to the public IP address of my server. This may take some time to propagate and certbot won't work until it has taken effect.</li><li>Install <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">certbot</a></li><li>Stop nginx from running, temporarily.</li><li>Use certbot to issue a<br><pre><code>./certbot-auto certonly --standalone \
  --standalone-supported-challenges http-01 \
  -d woodwind.yourdomain.com</code></pre></li></ol><p class="">This resulted in an SSL certificate and key pair that I could use to encrypt traffic to this domain.</p><p class="">Next up, I need something to actually handle the HTTPS requests and pass them along to uwsgi. I used <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">nginx</a>&nbsp;for this because I was already using it on this server. In my nginx config directory, I created a woodwind.conf file:</p><pre>upstream woodwind {<br>  server unix:/tmp/woodwind.sock;<br>}<br>upstream woodwind_wss {<br>  server localhost:8077;<br>}<br>server {<br>  listen *:80;<br>  server_name woodwind.maktro.net;<br>  server_tokens off;<br>  ssl on;<br>  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/woodwind.yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;<br>  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/woodwind.yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;<br>  ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;<br>  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;<br>  ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;<br>  ssl_ciphers "EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256+EECDH:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256+EDH:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES256-SHA:AES128-SHA:DES-CBC3-SHA:HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4";<br>  ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem;<br>  root /home/woodwind_user/woodwind;<br>  access_log /var/log/nginx/woodwind_access.log;<br>  error_log /var/log/nginx/woodwind_error.log;<br>  location /_updates {<br>    uwsgi_pass woodwind_wss;<br>  }<br>  location / {<br>    try_files /woodwind/static/$uri /frontend/$uri @woodwind;<br>  }<br>  location @woodwind {<br>    uwsgi_pass woodwind;<br>    include uwsgi_params;<br>    uwsgi_buffering off;<br>  }<br>}</pre><p class="">This nginx configuration has some things worth noting:</p><ul><li>In addition to running a process that answers regular HTTP requests on a unix socket at /tmp/woodwind.sock, Woodwind also runs a service that answers WebSocket traffic at localhost:8077 for nifty features like live updating the page in your browser when a feed is updated.<br></li><li>Woodwind serves some static files out of its /woodwind/static folder as well as the /frontend folder. I needed to install the dependencies in /frontend using npm:<br><pre><code>$ cd frontend
$ npm install --nodev</code></pre></li></ul><p class="">After all this setup, I restarted nginx and was able to visit Woodwind in my browser!<br></p><p class="">I am happy with my setup so far. I am not quite sure yet if I did the WebSockets configuration correctly, but in general things seem to be working alright. I hope this information is useful to someone down the road, even if it is just future me.</p>
