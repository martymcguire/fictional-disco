    <div class="post e-content">
<p class="">A couple of days ago I wrote up a set of instructions for <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2016/11/28/124055/">setting up a self-hosted copy of Woodwind with nginx and upstart</a>. Since then I noticed that many images were broken on the feeds I was looking at - a common problem when a site that is served with HTTPS is displaying images and other content from another site that is served with HTTP.</p><div class="medium-insert-images ui-sortable"><figure>
    <img src="https://media.martymcgui.re/00/eb/b7/cb/64d4d3c006585e950d0a743ad2c6b4b443f8336bee2c696b26520657.png" alt="" class="ui-sortable-handle">
        
<figcaption class="">Broken images are so 90s. But, like, sad 90s.</figcaption></figure></div><p class="">I noticed that the main site woodwind.xyz was serving images through special URLs like:</p><pre>https://woodwind.xyz/imageproxy/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmartymcgui.re%2Fimages%2Flogo.jpg&amp;op=noop&amp;sig=...</pre><p class="">Looking in the source code, I found that <a href="https://woodwind.xyz/imageproxy/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmartymcgui.re%2Fimages%2Flogo.jpg&amp;op=noop&amp;sig=73d286817747f1ed807dfa23fba0d381d0d104ca">Woodwind has support for image proxies</a>, which are neat little services that can help serve remote HTTP content over HTTPS, resize images on the fly, and more.</p><p class="">I'd been meaning to set up one of these services for my own site, so this seemed like a good time to jump in!</p><p class="">Since my server already has <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> I chose <a href="https://github.com/willnorris/imageproxy">Will Norris' imageproxy</a>, which has a similar deployment setup to how I am already running Woodwind: Upstart manages a standalone process and nginx acts as a proxy to pass along requests.</p><p class="">Installation was fairly simple, once I had my GOPATH set up correctly:</p><pre>go get https://github.com/willnorris/imageproxy</pre><p class="">For running a persistent service, Will has an <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/willnorris/imageproxy/master/etc/imageproxy.conf">example Upstart configuration</a>, which I modified a bit and placed in /etc/init/imageproxy.conf:</p><pre><code>description "Image Proxy server"
start on (net-device-up)
stop on runlevel [!2345]

respawn
exec start-stop-daemon --start -c www-data --exec /home/imageproxy_user/go/bin/imageproxy -- \
    -addr localhost:4593 \
    -log_dir /var/log/imageproxy \
    -cache /var/cache/imageproxy \
    -signatureKey @/etc/imageproxy.key</code></pre><p class="">Before starting up the service, there were a few extra steps:</p><p class="">Create /var/log/imageproxy and /var/cache/imageproxy and make sure they are owned by the www-data user.</p><p class="">Create the "<a href="https://github.com/willnorris/imageproxy/#signed-requests">signature key</a>" in /etc/imageproxy.key. This is used to authorize each image request so that random folks can't proxy random stuff through your imageproxy. I used the command line openssl tool for this, with an extra pass through awk to remove the newline character that openssl spits out.</p><pre>$ sudo openssl rand -base64 42 | awk 'BEGIN{ORS="";} {print} &gt; /etc/imageproxy.key</pre><p class="">I also made sure that /etc/imageproxy.key was owned and readable by www-data and no other user.</p><p class="">I could then start up the server with:</p><pre>sudo start imageproxy</pre><p class="">Next it was time to configure nginx to send proxied image requests along to imageproxy. I opened up the nginx woodwind.conf file that I had created and added a new location block:</p><pre>location ~ ^/imageproxy/ {<br>        # pattern match to capture the original URL to prevent URL<br>        # canonicalization, which would strip double slashes<br>        if ($request_uri ~ "/imageproxy/(.+)") {<br>            set $path $1;<br>            rewrite .* /$path break;<br>        }<br>        proxy_pass http://localhost:4593;<br>    }</pre><p class="">After restarting nginx, requests to https://woodwind.yourdomain.com/imageproxy/... would be forwarded to the imageproxy server.</p><p class="">Finally, it was time to configure Woodwind to use the proxy. I opened up woodwind.cfg and added two lines:</p><pre>IMAGEPROXY_URL = '/imageproxy'<br>IMAGEPROXY_KEY = '...' # the contents of /etc/imageproxy.key</pre><p class="">A quick restart of the Woodwind service, a browser refresh and I have images aplenty!</p><div class="medium-insert-images ui-sortable"><figure>
