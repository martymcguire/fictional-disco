<p>I&rsquo;ve been into hardware hacking on and off for much of my life, but I&rsquo;ve never really had the time and confidence to design and build my own hardware.  In recent years, projects like the open source <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> have been slowly convincing me that I just might be able to do this stuff.</p>

<p>When a recent <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/06/build_make_a_boarduino.html">Make blog article</a> showed nearly step-by-step instructions for building a breadboard-friendly Arduino clone called the <a href="http://ladyada.net/make/boarduino/index.html">Boarduino</a>, I felt compelled to order one and try to get it working with my new MacBook.</p>

<p>I ordered the DC Boarduino kit from <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=19">LadyAda&rsquo;s website</a>, along with the USB TTL-232 cable that would connect to my laptop&rsquo;s USB port.  I also ordered the 9V power supply on the site to power the Boarduino.</p>

<p>I found building the Boarduino to be pretty easy (=ahem= with only one screwup on my part) thanks to <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/boarduino/solder.html">LadyAda&rsquo;s detailed instructions</a>.  It was the first soldering project I had done in awhile, so I am happy that it went so well.</p>

<p>I next looked to the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MacOSX">Arduino OS X</a> guide for the software download and installation instructions.  I ended up grabbing version 11 of the Arduino software.  After unpacking the .zip file from the site, I installed the FTDI driver and rebooted, then plugged in the Boarduino&rsquo;s power and connected it to the laptop via USB.</p>

<p>Next, I double-clicked the Arduino application to start it, and nothing happened.  After messing around with it on the command line for awhile, I determined that it didn&rsquo;t like the version of Java I&rsquo;m using (I have the 64-bit version of Java 6 as my default).</p>

<p>So, to run the Arduino software, I had to temporarily set my preferred Java version to 5.0 via the Java Preferences panel in /Applications/Utilities/Java/.  Once I had changed my Java version, the Arduino app started right up with a double-click.  Once I was done with the app, I could set my Java preferences back to Java 6.</p>

<p>In the Arduino app, I set it up to communicate with the Boarduino by selecting &ldquo;Arduino NG or older w/ ATmega168&rdquo; under the <code>Tools | Board</code> menu.  I then opened up the Blink test program under <code>File | Sketchbook | Examples | Digital | Blink</code>.  To load the program onto the Boarduino, I pressed its reset button, then quickly clicked the &ldquo;Upload to I/O Board&rdquo; button on the interface.</p>

<p>The red LED on the Boarduino blinked rapidly as data was received, then it started blinking slowly as it ran the Blink program!  Hooray!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited that it&rsquo;s so easy to get something as powerful and versatile as the Boarduino up and running in just a couple of hours.  I&rsquo;m going to try and think of a couple of projects for it.  Whatever I do, I&rsquo;ll be sure to post about it here.</p>
