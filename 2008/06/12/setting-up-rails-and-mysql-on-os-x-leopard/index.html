<p>I recently purchased a MacBook to use as my primary development system.  One of my first plans was to get up and running with Rails on this new machine.  Given that Leopard (OS X 10.5) comes with Ruby version 1.8.6 and RubyGems 1.0.1, I thought I would be in good shape, but there were a couple of snags.  Thanks to the power of Google and other people with similar problems, I was able to get it sorted out.  Here&rsquo;s what I did:
<ol>
    <li>Updated rubygems to 1.1.1 with <code>sudo gem update &ndash;system</code></li>
    <li>Installed the 32-bit (x86, NOT x86_64) version of MySQL (community edition, of course) via the installer on the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#downloads">MySQL download page</a>.</li>
    <li>Installed the native MySQL driver for Ruby (this was tricky, see below)</li>
    <li>Finished by installing Rails and its friends via <code>gem install rails</code></li>
</ol>
Getting the speedier native MySQL driver for Ruby installed was tricky for two reasons.  It seems that by default the installer attempts to compile for 4 architectures, so you have to set an environment variable and pass along a parameter to point to the installed copy of MySQL when calling <code>gem</code>:
<pre lang="bash">sudo env ARCHFLAGS=”-arch i386” <br />
   gem install mysql &ndash; <br />
   &ndash;with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config</pre>
If you&rsquo;ve never seen it before, the &lsquo;&ndash;&rsquo; after &lsquo;gem install mysql&rsquo; means that gem should pass along the next arguments to the programs it uses to build the driver.</p>

<p>The reason for installing the 32-bit version of MySQL (on your fancy 64-bit OS and machine!) is that the version of Ruby that ships with Leopard is apparently 32-bit only.  Yikes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed several little annoying details like this in getting other things to work &ldquo;like I like&rdquo; on OS X.  I&rsquo;ll probably end up posting more about them in the next couple of posts.</p>

<p>I know that &ldquo;how to&rdquo; posts of the form &ldquo;I wanted to do X, but Y happened.  Finally I fixed it by Z,&rdquo; are pretty boring.  Still, I hope they are useful for preserving the knowledge of how to work around these problems, both for myself and for others.</p>
