dariusmccoy.com – Playing with Squarespace because he expects to have youth using it for the upcoming Web Shop launch at DHF. In ~3 weeks! He&#39;s trying to clone the existing DHF 3D Print Shop website in it, but finding it a bit restricting.">

<p>It's been a while! Again! We cancelled our previous meetup due to weather.</p>
<p>Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-05-29-homebrew-website-club">second Homebrew Website Club of May</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on May 29th!</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dariusmccoy.com/">dariusmccoy.com</a> – Playing with Squarespace because he expects to have youth using it for the upcoming Web Shop launch at DHF. In ~3 weeks! He's trying to clone the existing <a href="http://printshop.digitalharbor.org/">DHF 3D Print Shop website</a> in it, but finding it a bit restricting. Playing w/ some CodePens for nice animations/transitions but having trouble getting those into the Squarespace editing tools. Wants to use them for within-page links.</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://derekfields.is/">derekfields.is</a> – Been struggling w/ goals on personal website stuff. Has been applying for webdev jobs, though! Waiting to hear back. Has been working on his startup idea - an LED backpack for biking. It's controlled by a microcontroller and he wants it to serve a webpage over WiFi so you can control it from your phone without installing anything.
  <br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> – Spent time tonight writing a post because he hasn't in a long time. The post includes shaming himself for not writing posts. Writing up his experiences from a recent conference where DHF was receiving an award. Building apps with GatsbyJS which are PWAs that work offline, so the content he writes for DHF can work for people who have viewed them even if the internet goes down.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> – "Launched" his GIPHY-backed GIF posting app <a href="http://kapowski.schmarty.net/">Kapowski</a>. After feedback from last time, made it work without requiring logins (making it usable by people who aren't all wired up with IndieAuth on their sites). Thinking about ways to progressively enhance Kapowski, such as saving favorites that can be viewed offline, offline sending with posts going out when the internet comes back, etc. Been going all in on micropub for his personal notes that exist on a private site. Used <a href="https://github.com/Inklings-io/selfauth">selfauth</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Zegnat/php-mintoken">mintoken</a>, <a href="https://github.com/skpy/micropub">skippy's micropub server</a>, <a href="https://github.com/martymcguire/spano">spano for media</a>, and built a new <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html">nginx auth_request</a> service that uses IndieAuth and an access control list to allow only him to view the private posts. Hoping to clean that up and release it someday soon. Also started first steps for another long-term micropub-related project to assist sites that support micropub for creating and editing posts but don't want to build their own infrastructure for syndication. It's called <a href="https://glitch.com/~fanatical-wound">"POSSE Party"</a>, and currently it's a <a href="https://indieweb.org/manual_until_it_hurts">manual-til-it-hurts</a> Micropub editor that lets you manage mp-syndicate-to and syndication properties for posts. Someday he hopes to make something that can use bridgy or silo.pub to automate syndication for people whose sites don't do that.</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    LED mounting strategies for backpacks. Big diffusers make for good looking LEDs but surface mount parts make things easier to mount.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Jonathan's experiences at the conference. His takeaways from talks about making human-centered technology. E.g. "context is everything, a perfectly engineered span is useless, but the Brooklyn bridge connects people". He's thinking a lot about common themes around technology that works *for* humans. For example, so many people don't have internet all the time!</li>
