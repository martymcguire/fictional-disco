Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-07-11-homebrew-website-club">first Homebrew Website Club of July</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on July 11th! 
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> ‚Äî Been building static HTML/CSS layouts for fun! <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/learning/fun-with-html-css-layouts-part-one-layouts-1-3/">Some</a>¬†<a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/learning/fun-with-html-css-layouts-part-two/">examples</a>. Also started practicing turning those designs into layouts in <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a>. Had a usability testing call w/ the folks from <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a> that turned into a great discussion about how to better build community starters.</p>
<a href="http://www.dariusmccoy.com/">dariusmccoy.com</a> ‚Äî Was having some issues w/ his site, which is hosted on AWS. He is thinking about wiping his instance and starting a new one, since he has lost track of some of his passwords. In a tricky spot because AWS doesn't offer any tech support for free tier users. Talked about switching to Digital Ocean or something simpler but will have to balance his budgets to justify the costs.
<p><a href="http://derekfields.is/">derekfields.is</a>¬†‚Äî Been taking a Udemy course on VueJS. Before that has been working on a schedule for developing his website. Has a friend doing the same and they mutually keep each other on track to spend a certain amount of time on developing their skills and sites. It's kind of working!</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> ‚Äî Brought a bunch of stickers and other fun things home from IndieWeb Summit! Had a great time seeing folks he met last year and meeting new folks. Lots of great discussion sessions, hacking projects, wild ideas, and more. He really needs to write it up on his site! His hack day project also desperately needs to be written up ‚Äì it's an IndieWeb-style web ring, available at <a>üï∏üíç.ws</a>¬†! This week he added support for <a href="https://indielogin.com/">indielogin.com</a>, which lets people sign in using their own websites by <a href="https://indieweb.org/RelMeAuth">setting up only a couple of links</a>.
  <br />
</p>
Other discussion:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/2018">IndieWeb Summit</a>! Marty went and loved it. Next year would love to bring more folks from HWC Baltimore, and travel assistance is available. We'll work on it.</li>
  <li>
    Marty met <a href="http://ewy.me/">Jared Ewy</a>¬†of <a href="https://name.com/">name.com</a>¬†at the Summit and talked about all the cool work DHF does teaching youth to build websites, the upcoming Web Shop, hosting HWC and IWC Baltimore, etc. Jared gave him a bunch of codes for free domains and some hosting discounts to benefit that work, so we discussed lots of ideas!
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Some possibilities: give Web Shop youth employees incentive to work on their own projects, outside of paid jobs, to learn more about building their own sites. Host a special Homebrew Website Club that's a 2-hour jam for new folks who don't have a domain yet to get set up with a website. Host a longer "Build Your Website Day" (maybe in coordination with a <a href="https://twitter.com/sdepolo/status/1011739362122334208">multi-city Drag Queen Build-a-Website Day</a>?)</li>
  <li>What would an IndieWeb "starter pack" look like for a quick "you have a domain but no money" way to get started? GitHub looks good for skill building for folks that want to get into web development someday because it's mostly managed by hand. Netlify looks pretty good for this because they offer hosting, flexible static site generation, SSL for HTTPS, and the NetlifyCMS. They also support some features like building your own webhooks on JavaScript, which could eventually be used to handle common IndieWeb building block endpoints (IndieAuth, Micropub, Webmention, ...) Because they run all the stuff for a given site from a git repository, it's possible to take a site from Netlify and set it up elsewhere if their offerings change.</li>
  <li>"Packages" for a getting started workshop. E.g. "what will you get at the end + what will you need to learn along the way." Static HTML/CSS on GitHub could get a portfolio site done. For $5/mo a <a href="http://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> site can be hosted on a custom domain and requires no Git/GitHub wrangling. <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> hosting is also $5/mo and brings a ton of features, interactivity, and community.</li>
  <li>Talked about VueJS passing React in terms of number of stars on GitHub, and speculating why that is. For example, VueJS can be a lot easier to dip your toes in and get started without a complicated build toolchain.</li>
</ul>
