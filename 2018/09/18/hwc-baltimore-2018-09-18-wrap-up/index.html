<p>Baltimore's <a href="https://indieweb.org/events/2018-09-18-homebrew-website-club">first Homebrew Website Club of September</a> met at the <a href="https://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on September 18th.</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://jonathanprozzi.net/">jonathanprozzi.net</a> — Has been travelling and getting married and had lots of time to think about things! Not to work on them, though. Catching back up on things like Gatsby pages for Digital Harbor Foundation. Feeling some maintenance pains now with Gatsby's GraphQL queries pulling HUGE amounts of data from a WordPress backend – about a 5 minute process for each site build. Upgrading to Gatsby 2 would also require a bunch of changes that he isn't wanting to do. Also, something in the Gatsby build process just broke, without him making any code changes. Wishing now he had built the site in <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>, which uses REST over GraphQL. For his personal site, he is thinking about how much effort he wants to put into things. He typically uses his personal site as a way to learn new technology, but is now wary of force-fitting things that aren't a good fit. Maybe tweaking his current WordPress site would be a better use of time than rewriting the site. Particularly since he hasn't posted since July.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://rhearamakrishnan.com/">rhearamakrishnan.com</a> — Not much new on her personal site, since it's working well for her purposes. Posted some new stuff she made over the summer, including a micro chap-book called <a href="https://ghostcitypress.com/2018-summer-microchap-series/it-makes-more-noise-than-i-thought-it-would">It Makes More Noise Than I Thought It Would</a>. Been working on other summer projects, like writing poems on postcards for people. Photographing and typing those up to make a mini-collection. Wants to build something on <a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine</a>, if she can include a form so people can write letters back to her. She's gonna write out the adventure as she wants it and then think about what kind of interactivity she'd like from readers. Thinking about designing a mini-course for DHF around Twine for students to build stories around it.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://martymcgui.re/">martymcgui.re</a> — Hasn't really made much progress on any personal or IndieWeb projects since the last HWC meeting. Had a couple of out of town trips and projects that were good and fulfilling experiences, like going to <a href="https://www.improvutopia.com/iu-east/">Camp Improv Utopia East</a>. Those experiences highlighted that maybe he is feeling burned out about some IndieWeb things! For example, he has been letting the <a href="https://martymcgui.re/podcasts/indieweb/">This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition</a> slip more and more each week and finding it hard to focus. He's trying to figure out what to do for the upcoming IndieWebCamp NYC, which he is excited about, but feeling a bit overwhelmed by project ideas, things he should be doing to help organize, etc.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>https://twinery.org/ is great for creating interactive stuff - and it seems like the output is plain HTML? So it should be possible to add a form from some service like <a href="https://formspree.io/">Formspree</a> or <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> to an exported project, if the tool doesn't offer exactly that kind of thing.</li>
  <li>Dealing with burnout and feeling stuck on things. Sometimes it helps to get energized by doing something else. Sometimes doing those other things really highlights that you have energy, just not for those things you're burned out on!</li>
  <li>Principle of Least Power is another big thing, here. Jonathan and Marty have both been struggling with projects where the tooling or the plumbing may be taking all the energy available.</li>
  <li>Semantic HTML and CSS can do so much, now. We looked at this <a href="http://www.mattzeunert.com/2017/10/30/javascript-free-todo-app.html">CSS-only TODO MVC proof of concept</a>. Talked about HTML definition lists, summary/details tags, figure/figcaption, and more.</li>
  <li>
    Talked about the <a href="https://sonniesedge.co.uk/talks/dear-developer">pyramid of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and the inverted pyramid of overbuilt JS-dependent frameworks</a>.
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>
