<p>Baltimore's second <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/09/20/125531/">Homebrew Website Club of October</a> met at the <a href="https://digitialharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on October 16th.</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>
  jonathanprozzi.net — Worked today on a post recapping our last HWC meeting, focusing on ideas to get more people involved. For work at DHF, still learning lots of NextJS and ExpressJS. Getting back into writing content!
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  derekfields.is — Been a while! Last week in Minnesota for some networking. Met some cool people and talked to some companies, including <a href="https://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a>, which was part of <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/">Open Baltimore</a>. Also got back into bullet journaling after being away for a while. Working on legal and client-finding stuff for his freelance work.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  pulianas.com — Also been awhile since he's been to an HWC! Moved all his sites to HTTPS. His podcast (overanalyzed.fm) is now on iTunes, so he added that link to the site. Also tried to track down an official Overcast button but hasn't found it yet. Recently in San Jose for API World. Very little talk about building APIs and more about pitching specific products/services. Did learn a bit about microservices and case-studies of moving to them. Did some general maintenance on his WP site, and has been working on his own plugin for podcasting on WP.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  martymcgui.re — Been heavily porting his site from Jekyll to Hugo. Has had some fun porting things that he did as Ruby plugins for Jekyll into crazy Go template logic, like generating permashortlinks in <a href="http://tantek.pbworks.com/w/page/19402946/NewBase60">NewBase60</a>. Also had some fun setting up a new CSS Grid display for photos in posts with lots of them (<a href="https://martymcgui.re/2018/10/06/144700/">example</a> which apparently only works in Firefox). Also, after some struggling with his image proxy setup (because Hugo templating doesn't support HMAC signatures) is trying out <a href="https://cloudinary.com/">Cloudinary's</a> free tier for his image-resizing needs.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Other discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Podcasting on WordPress is... a pain. Apple Podcasts refused to accept their feed due to http vs https issues and that was hard to track down.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.wooji-juice.com/products/ferrite/">Ferrite</a> for audio editing on the iPad. Alec edits his podcasts there now. Some hiccups with the noise-cancelling and auto-levelling features being too-aggressive.</li>
  <li>Recording setups. <a href="https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti-nano/">Blue's new Yeti Nano</a> looks cool.</li>
  <li>
    FF and Chrome starting to support the new dialog element. Maybe cool, maybe terrible?
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>
