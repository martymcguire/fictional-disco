<p>Like many <a href="http://makerbot.com/">MakerBot</a> owners, I feel compelled to help spread desktop 3D printing throughout the world.  So, for the past several months, <a href="/makerbot_131">MakerBot #131</a> has been hard at work printing parts in 3D to make another 3D printer!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Mendel">Mendel</a> is the second (and current) design for the <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page">RepRap project</a>, whose goal is to create rapid-prototyping machines that can replicate themselves.  As an Open Source Hardware project, everything about the <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Subversion">Mendel&rsquo;s design is available online</a> via Subversion, from the mechanical parts to the electronics schematics, to the source code for the device and its host machine.  Additionally, there is a <a href="http://forums.reprap.org/">fantastic community</a> of very smart people who are constantly improving the design, trying new things, and helping others get their RepRaps working!</p>

<p>While the Mendel requires various hardware bits such as motors, electronics, nuts and bolts, etc., its structure is about 51% 3D-printed parts.  This works out to about 98 individual pieces that need to be printed, and represents a huge number of printing hours.</p>

<p>To get started, I used a .zip file full of the 3D STL files for these parts that someone very nicely prepared and uploaded to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/makerbot/">MakerBot Operators group</a>.  These files were from the 1.0 release of Mendel, so some of them ended up being out of date, and a few had issues that made them unprintable.  Thankfully, another kind MakerBot operator uploaded a <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1768">fully prepared set</a> to <a href="http://thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a>, so I could go there for a replacement whenever I found a part that wouldn&rsquo;t print.
<p style="text-align: left;">I started printing Mendel parts almost as soon as I got MakerBot #131 working.  Since I knew it was going to be a long process, I created a <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Ag-Fo1q90EdudDdTTndobmcyR2taaktXd3dTT2wyVkE#gid=0">spreadsheet to help me track and estimate</a> the time it would take to complete the build.  I also used some silly Javascript magic to display a progress bar on my MakerBot #131 page based on this spreadsheet data:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.creatingwithcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mendel_complete.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-122 aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="100% Complete! So satisfying." src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.creatingwithcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mendel_complete.png" alt="" width="504" height="100" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This hack was accomplished by building my own JSONP into some cells of the spreadsheet, and loading this content as Javascript using Google Spreadsheet&rsquo;s plain text export capability.  The spreadsheet cells were set up like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.creatingwithcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mendel_jsonp.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-123" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Here be dragons:   update_mendel_progress('    =N47    '   );" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.creatingwithcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mendel_jsonp.png" alt="" width="500" height="33" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here, column N47 contains the &ldquo;completeness&rdquo; of the Mendel as a value of 0.0 - 1.0 in terms of number of hours printed so far divided by the expected number of hours total.  This data could be used on an HTML page with an &ldquo;update_mendel_progress&rdquo; function by loading it with a script tag:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><code>&lt;script src=&ldquo;<a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=t7SNwhng2GkZjKWwwSOl2VA&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;range=B52:E52&amp;output=txt&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;">http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=t7SNwhng2GkZjKWwwSOl2VA&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;range=B52:E52&amp;output=txt&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</a></code></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The range &ldquo;B52:E52&rdquo; are the cells in my spreadsheet containing the JSONP call, and the &ldquo;output=txt&rdquo; option returns the data as tab-separated data, which Javascript is happy to parse.  The update_mendel_progress method on that page parses the number that is passed in, looks for an HTML DIV element with an id of &ldquo;mendel_progress&rdquo;, updates it to be the appropriate width, and displays the percentage completion.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At any rate, after a lot of tweaking, many hair-raising moments, a required upgrade with the <a href="http://store.makerbot.com/cupcake-cnc/makerbot-cupcake-heated-build-platform-v2-0.html">MakerBot Heated Build Platform v2.0</a>, and hours and hours of printing, the parts were finally complete!  I gave them to <a href="http://cibomahto.com/">Matt Mets</a>, a member of <a href="http://hackpittsburgh.org/">HackPittsburgh</a>, and you can see the photos he took of the parts, above!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite some of the parts belonging to a slightly out-of-date design, Matt has been <a href="http://www.cibomahto.com/2010/06/mendel-progress/">making progress</a> on getting everything together!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.cibomahto.com/2010/06/mendel-progress/"><img class="alignnone" title="Matt's Mendel Progress, photo by Matt Mets." src="http://www.cibomahto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/DSC_7132.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can follow Matt&rsquo;s progress on <a href="http://www.cibomahto.com/">his blog</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&rsquo;m very happy to have finished off such a large project with MakerBot #131, and I have a lot of plans for it in the future, so be sure to watch this space for more updates!</p></p>
