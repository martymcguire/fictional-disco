<p>In the previous posts in this series, I <a href="/howto/makerbot-cam-1-chdk/">hacked up a Canon camera</a> to take pictures with an electronic trigger, <a href="/howto/makerbot-cam-2-wiring/">built a cable</a> to connect the camera to my MakerBot, and <a href="/howto/makerbot-cam-3-firmware/">hacked the MakerBot&rsquo;s firmware</a> to enable it to trigger the camera in response to commands from the controlling computer.</p>

<p>The final step was to hack the desktop software that controls the MakerBot - ReplicatorG.</p>

<h3>What is ReplicatorG?</h3>

<p>From the <a href="http://replicat.org/">ReplicatorG website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>[ReplicatorG] is the software that will drive your CupCake CNC, RepRap machine, or generic CNC machine. You can give it a GCode or STL file to process, and it takes it from there. Its cross platform, easily installed, and is based on the familiar Arduino / Processing environments.</blockquote>

<p>For my purposes, ReplicatorG provides two things. First, RepG is a user interface for controlling the MakerBot hardware:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/phooky/4604290256/sizes/o/"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.creatingwithcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/replicator_g_control_panel.png" alt="" title="RepG extruder control panel. Image by phooky, CC-BY-SA." width="426" height="437" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-218" /></a></p>

<p>Second, RepG reads <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code">G-code</a> files describing how to build an object, and transmits them to the MakerBot over the USB:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/makerbot/4816221120/sizes/m/"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.creatingwithcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/repg_gcode.jpg" alt="" title="RepG G-code viewer. Image by makerbot, CC-BY." width="476" height="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-220" /></a></p>

<p>Of course, ReplicatorG is open source, and the code is <a href="http://github.com/makerbot/ReplicatorG">available on GitHub</a>!  So, it was simple to clone their repository and start hacking on it myself.</p>

<h3>Camera Control via ReplicatorG</h3>

<p>While it was relatively simple to update the extruder controller firmware to make it camera-aware, ReplicatorG is a bit more complicated.  My first goal was to hack a new &ldquo;Camera&rdquo; checkbox into the control panel.  Whenever the box was checked, the camera would take pictures. Whenever the box was unchecked, the camera would be idle.</p>

<p>You can find the code required for these changes in <a href="http://github.com/martymcguire/ReplicatorG/commit/6b967b4e7dd115a674c3e223d3abc7119ab44c1a">this commit on GitHub</a>, but I will try to briefly break them down here:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Define a new machine</strong>.  In the <code>machines.xml.dist</code> file, I defined an experimental MakerBot configuration named &ldquo;EXPERIMENTAL - Cupcake CNC w/HBP and remote camera&rdquo;.  It is essentially a copy of the typical MakerBot configuration with a heated build platform, but in the <code>&lt;tool&gt;</code> definition, I also added a <code>camera=&ldquo;true&rdquo;</code> attribute.</li>
        <li><strong>Update the tool model</strong>. In <code>ToolModel.java</code>, I added code to represent whether the tool has an attached camera, whether the camera is activated, and how to parse the <code>camera</code> attribute out of <code>machines.xml</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Update the machine driver model</strong>.  In <code>Driver.java</code>, <code>DriverBaseImplementation.java</code>, and <code>Sanguino3GDriver.java</code>, I added the definitions and implementations to <code>triggerCamera()</code> and <code>stopTriggeringCamera()</code>.  This is the code that actually sends the <code>TOGGLE_CAMERA</code> serial command to the extruder controller, which I also defined in <code>ToolCommandCode.java</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Update the control panel interface</strong>. In <code>ExtruderPanel.java</code>, I added the code to draw a new label and checkbox named &ldquo;Camera&rdquo;, if the machine is configured for a camera, and to respond to check/uncheck events by calling <code>triggerCamera()</code> or <code>stopTriggeringCamera()</code>.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Compiling and Running the new ReplicatorG</h3>

<p>Compiling ReplicatorG is pretty simple, so long as you have a reasonable JDK environment and have Ant on your path.  There are basically two steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Copy <code>machines.xml.dist to</code>machines.xml`.</li>
<li>Run the proper <code>dist-linux.sh</code>, <code>dist-mac.sh</code>, or <code>dist-windows.sh</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>ReplicatorG will be compiled and packaged up into the <code>dist/</code> directory in two forms: an installable package for the chosen platform, and an unpacked version that you can run directly.</p>

<p>Opening up my modified version of ReplicatorG, I selected the &ldquo;EXPERIMENTAL - Cupcake CNC w/HBP and remote camera&rdquo; profile from the <strong>Machine -&gt; Driver</strong> menu, opened up the control panel, and was happy to see this:</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.creatingwithcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/control-panel-cam.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.creatingwithcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/control-panel-cam.png" alt="" title="RepG control panel... with camera trigger! It's down there, I swear." width="446" height="474" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-234" /></a></p>

<p>After hooking up my camera to the extruder controller&rsquo;s <code>D9</code> port, and starting the <code>Remote Button</code> script on the camera, I was able to take pictures by quickly toggling the camera checkbox on and off.  I could also leave the checkbox activated to make the camera take pictures continuously.</p>

<h3>Automatic Triggering with G-codes</h3>

<p>Being able to trigger the camera by hand is all well and good, but my goal was to take pictures automatically at the end of every layer.  To do this, I needed to be able to embed camera trigger commands in the G-code for building each individual object.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="http://replicat.org/gcodes">ReplicatorG G-code docs</a>, and the (machine-specific) <a href="http://replicat.org/mcodes">M-code docs</a>, I chose two codes for working with the camera:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>M150</code> - Trigger Camera</li>
<li><code>M151</code> - Stop Triggering Camera</li>
</ul>

<p>I may have to change these in the future, as the main ReplicatorG development team claim G- and M-codes for other features, but these work for now.</p>

<p>Modifying ReplicatorG to accept these M-codes (<a href="http://github.com/martymcguire/ReplicatorG/commit/876732b6a70bdaf4389476bfdf240d629ee50017">GitHub commit here</a>) was straightforward: update <code>GCodeParser.java</code> to recognize the codes, and call the appropriate <code>triggerCamera()</code> and <code>stopTriggeringCamera()</code> methods.</p>

<p>I could now construct a G-code file which, when &ldquo;built&rdquo; in ReplicatorG, would take a picture on demand:</p>

<pre><code>M150     (trigger the camera)
G4 P700  (wait 0.7 seconds for the camera to activate)
M151     (stop triggering)
G4 P1300 (wait 1.3 seconds for the camera to finish)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, it was time to edit up the G-code for the models I want to photograph.</p>

<p>Typically, G-code is generated by taking a 3D object in STL format and running it through the <a href="http://www.bitsfrombytes.com/wiki/index.php?title=Skeinforge">Skeinforge</a> tool.  Skeinforge is a set of Python scripts, which means it is not too difficult to insert your own code.</p>

<p>For now, however, I decided to make a simple hack using a Perl script I wrote called <code>add_camera_events.pl</code>.  It works by looking for <code>(&lt;/layer&gt;)</code> comments, which signal the end of a layer of printing, and inserts lines to:
<ol>
    <li>Move to a standard pose (<code>X=0, Y=-45</code>),</li>
    <li>Trigger the camera and wait for it to finish, and</li>
    <li>Move back to the original position</li>
</ol></p>

<p>You can find the source for this script in the <a href="https://gist.github.com/489805">add_camera_events.pl gist</a>.  The source for all of my changes to ReplicatorG are on GitHub, in the &ldquo;schmarty-camera&rdquo; branch of <a href="http://github.com/martymcguire/ReplicatorG/tree/schmarty-camera">my fork of ReplicatorG</a>.</p>

<p>And with that, the computer aspect of this system was finally done!</p>

<h3>Wrap Up</h3>

<p>Phew!  So far I&rsquo;ve hacked a camera, wired it to the MakerBot, updated the MakerBot firmware to trigger it, updated ReplicatorG to trigger it, and written a script to update G-code files with camera triggers at the end of each layer.</p>

<p>So&hellip; does it work?  <a href="/makerbot/automatic-makerbot-time-lapse-photography/">You bet</a>!  Stay tuned for more examples and a breakdown video of this whole project in the final post in this series!</p>
