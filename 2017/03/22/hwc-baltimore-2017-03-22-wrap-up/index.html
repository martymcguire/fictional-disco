martymcgui.re has been busy since the last meeting. Added tags and displaying webmentions to his site. Launched Screech, a micropub client for posting audio. Uses it to post an audio edition of the This Week in the IndieWeb as a podcast. Started looking into better reply contexts for sites with no microformats2 info, maybe starting with Soundcloud (which requires using their API to convert permalinks into embeds) or using Aaron Parecki&#39;s X-Ray.">

<p>Notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p>martymcgui.re has been busy since the last meeting. Added tags and displaying webmentions to his site. Launched <a href="https://screech.schmarty.net/">Screech</a>, a micropub client for posting audio. Uses it to post an audio edition of the <a href="https://martymcgui.re/tag/this-week-indieweb-podcast/">This Week in the IndieWeb as a podcast</a>. Started looking into better reply contexts for sites with no microformats2 info, maybe starting with Soundcloud (which requires using their API to convert permalinks into embeds) or using Aaron Parecki's X-Ray.</p>
<p>
  brianey.com missed the last meeting, so it's been a while. Working on a new site at <a href="http://thebrianyoung.com">thebrianyoung.com</a>, set up his WordPress network to include IndieWeb plugins, including things like accepting Webmentions. Some small updates to <a href="http://imnotwrong.com/">imnotwrong.com</a>. Committing to more (of everything) for next time.

  eddiehinkle.com started blogging again back in February. Dusted off Jekyll and started delving back into IndieWeb. Reads a lot of books and wanted to have that info on his site from Goodreads. Uses a Node.js script to dump Goodreads data into Jekyll _data/ folder. Added microformats to pages. Posts project 365 photos to site, a little bit of a burden since everything is still manual. Current project is micropub. Plan is to set up a Node.js "controller" because he wants to do more responses and interactive things. Today added "On This Day", showing posts from the same day in previous years

<p>maryreisenwitz.com was in the other half of the room working on laser-cutting projects, but did talk informally about wanting to add e-commerce to her site.</p>
<p>We discussed the shutdown of App.net, the upcoming micro.blog, the challenges of building everything yourself, and some of the laser-cutting projects that our host Mary was working on for an event next weekend.</p>
