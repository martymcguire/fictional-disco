SUMMARY:Digital Self-Defense: A Workshop
DESCRIPTION:Ever worry that the internet knows more about you than you know about it? Companies, governments, and individuals can collect and track our communications and metadata whether we give informed consent or not. Meanwhile, those most vulnerable to these online risks may not have the greatest access to the information and resources to defend against surveillance and discrimination.\nWe can organize to change this, but in the meantime, there are also steps we can take to protect each other and to educate ourselves about what&rsquo;s at stake. Learning to navigate digital space safely is a process, but you don&rsquo;t have to get started alone.\nJoin us 3&frasl;19 for a workshop on digital privacy, inspired by the international Cryptoparty movement. We&rsquo;ll talk about why surveillance matters for all of us and why you don&rsquo;t need a technical background to start taking control of your online privacy. You&rsquo;ll have a chance to ask questions, try out tools on your phone or laptop, and learn more about specific topics like mobile phone security, secure browsing, and more.\nAll people and all levels of experience are welcome.\nThe event will be FREE, however donations to help with the costs of the space and event will be welcome and appreciated! We&rsquo;ll also have snacks available but welcome others to bring more to share, potluck style.\nLearn more and (optionally) RSVP via our Facebook Event: https://www.facebook.com/events/158952891285370/\n
