<p>Below are notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup.</p>
<p>jonathanprozzi.net - not been making his weekly posts in challenges with Marty. Inspired by a nearby bookstore closing, realized he had done lots of learning in bookstores over the last ~15 years. New idea for a series of posts cataloging all the things learned in a specific place over the years. Wants to journal the things he is learning on a weekly(ish) basis to build an archive.</p>
<p>brianey.com - been writing up lots of ideas for his blog but not finishing them. Based on that unfinished work, started writing about some new topics on creativity. For example, writing about starting things vs. achieving them. Looking forward to writing those including cute graphics of badgers, (em)barkers, etc. and being inspired by those posts to take on other unfinished posts.</p>
<p>amyhurst.com - working on an FAQ page for all the questions she gets from students seeking to get into the grad programs that she manages. It should be a useful resource for students, but also for her to copy and paste into emails from students who don't or won't read it.</p>
<p>martymcgui.re - brought a bunch of posts from an old blog into his site, including old comments from disqus. Did updates to site plumbing so he can add syndication to his posts after the fact with micropub updates, allowing him to get webmentions and notifications of interactions on Twitter, FB, etc via brid.gy without pulling out a laptop.</p>
<p>We talked about the upcoming <a href="https://2017.indieweb.org/">2017 IndieWeb Summit June 24th-25th in Portland, Oregon</a> and discussed the indie RSVPs on the site. From there we ended up on <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">Aaron Parecki</a>'s site and chatted about the amount of information that is collected and shared, what things we'd like to be collecting for review about ourselves, what things we're comfortable publishing.</p>

Below are notes from the &#34;broadcast&#34; portion of the meetup.
jonathanprozzi.net - Since last time, did some cosmetic updates to site. Also did a lot of traveling. Catching up now on finishing a series of posts he started at last HWC (May 10th). Now one-and-a-half posts behind his schedule. Wants to stick with consistency of writing something once per week.
