<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/2017/01/27/163523/">Baltimore's February 2017 meetup for Homebrew Website Club</a> met at the <a href="http://www.digitalharbor.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center</a> on Feb 8th.</p>
<p>Notes from the "broadcast" portion of the meetup:</p>
<p>martymcgui.re - reworked his micropub server to support the media endpoint he was working on last time. also added venue pages to his site for event locations. made progress on event-posting micropub client (eventually will be released publicly). also added support for deleted posts with dt-deleted and meta http-equiv status 410 gone.</p>
<p>jonathanprozzi.net - refactoring site templates. spent a lot of time debugging some simple problems, h-cards. wants to figure out a way to track incremental work on website when other work things are crazy so threads don't get lost. wants to keep segmenting his Hugo template while maintaining mf2 stuff. goal is to get to working on appearance of his site theme.</p>
<p>
  jjuran.org - currently working on a <a href="http://www.jjuran.org/cv/projects/">CV on his site</a>. first use of img srcset to feed high-res images to clients that want them. uses his own Perl-based static site generator that is "showing its age". working on his own programming language so he can spend most of his time writing code in a high-level language.
  <br />
</p>
<p>We discussed the challenges of building your own tools for fun vs. starting from the goal of posting more (e.g. via Wordpress).</p>
