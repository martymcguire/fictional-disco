Packaged and released his first Python package, a Flask IndieAuth lib for micropub servers, has a proof of concept micropub media server built on Flask-HashFS.</p><p class="">brianey.com - lots of WordPress IndieWeb plugins setup on his site. Has IndieAuth working. Thinks micropub is working. Also integrating these into humor/fake-advice site imnotwrong.com, POSSE to Medium. Discovered that people still use StumbleUpon and got some good traffic from there.</p><p class="">jeancedre.com - wrote down list of things to do to refresh portfolio site. Chose new color scheme and brought it into Sketch to start designing. New website will mean new logo, layout, etc., and eventually business cards based on that. Not sure if wants to use WordPress "because it's overkill". Discussed how he wants to "use" the site, as the author, since WP provides a nice CMS that supports lots of workflows.</p><p class="">jonathanprozzi.net - did lots of refactoring of his Hugo theme into logical partials. Goal is to make a Hugo theme that supports IndieWeb via mf2 out of the box. Has also started making an ongoing list of all the changes he has been making, or wants to make, on his site.<br></p><p class="">We discussed the renewed IndieWeb interest in automatically archiving our posts and links to the Internet Archive, prompted by the content deletions and Twitter censoring of the new U.S. gov't administration. We also discussed the upcoming <a href="http://cryptoparty.in/baltimore">CryptoParty Baltimore happening in a little over a week on Feb 4th</a>.</p><div class="medium-insert-images ui-sortable"><figure>
